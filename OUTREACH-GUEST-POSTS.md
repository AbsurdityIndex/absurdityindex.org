### 1A. McSweeney's Internet Tendency

**Contact:** websubmissions@mcsweeneys.net
**Format:** Max 1,200 words, list or essay format
**Turnaround:** 6--8 weeks; no simultaneous submissions

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Submission -- "Minutes From the Congressional Committee on Things Everyone Already Agrees On"

Dear Editors,

I'd like to submit a humor piece titled "Minutes From the Congressional Committee on Things Everyone Already Agrees On." It's a fake committee transcript in which legislators debate whether to formally acknowledge that the sky is blue, whether pizza is still a vegetable (per USDA classification, it technically is), and whether "recess" should count as legislating.

The piece is inspired by the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), a satirical commentary site I built that scores real federal legislation on a 1--10 absurdity scale. The committee transcript format lets me juxtapose real procedural absurdity -- things like the Senate spending floor time naming post offices while landmark bills die in committee -- with satirical proposals so reasonable that Congress would never pass them.

I can keep it under 1,200 words. Happy to revise based on your feedback.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: Call to order of the "Subcommittee on Things Everyone Already Agrees On" -- the chair notes the committee has never met because all members agree there is no point
- Middle: Three agenda items drawn from real legislative absurdities (tortured bill acronyms, billion-dollar omnibus riders nobody read, unanimous consent on naming a hallway)
- Climax: A member proposes a bill that actually makes sense; parliamentary chaos ensues as nobody knows the procedure for passing something reasonable
- Closing: The committee adjourns indefinitely, scheduling a follow-up meeting "right after Congress reads the next omnibus bill cover to cover"
- Footnotes with real Congress.gov links throughout

**Format:** Humor essay or list, 600--1,200 words
**Submit:** pointsincase.com/submit

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Pitch -- "I Built a Website That Scores Congressional Bills on an Absurdity Scale. Congress Still Wins."

Hi Points in Case,

I'd like to pitch a first-person humor essay about building absurdityindex.org, a satirical site that scores real federal bills on a 1--10 Absurdity Index. The essay follows me down the rabbit hole of reading actual bill text -- discovering gems like the COVFEFE Act (real), the Saving Our Sequoias Act that spent more per tree than most Americans earn per year (real), and the realization that Congressional Bingo is less a game and more a documentary.

The hook: when I started writing satirical bills as alternatives, the hardest part was making them more absurd than the real ones. Tone would be self-deprecating, escalating absurdity, with real Congress.gov links as punchlines.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- "I started reading congressional bills for fun. That was my first mistake."
- Discovery of real absurdities: tortured acronyms, pork-barrel spending hidden in omnibus bills, bills that spent more on paperwork than the program they funded
- The moment satirical bills started losing to reality in an absurdity contest
- Interactive features as punchlines: Congressional Bingo, the "Would You Pass It?" swipe game where players can't tell real bills from fake ones
- Closing: an invitation to visit absurdityindex.org, with the warning that knowing how Congress works may be hazardous to your optimism

### 1C. Weekly Humorist

**Submit:** weeklyhumorist.com/submit
**Format:** Humor essay, list, or fake news, 400--1,000 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Submission -- "Congressional Bill or Rejected Onion Headline? A Quiz You Will Fail"

Hi Weekly Humorist,

I'd like to submit a quiz-style humor piece: "Congressional Bill or Rejected Onion Headline?" The format presents ten items -- five are real bill titles (or summaries) from Congress.gov, and five are satirical bills I wrote for absurdityindex.org. Readers guess which are real. The reveal includes links to Congress.gov for the real ones.

The premise is simple: actual legislation is now indistinguishable from satire. I have the data to prove it -- the Absurdity Index scores real federal bills on a 1--10 scale, and the average keeps climbing.

Happy to adjust format or length.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Brief intro framing the challenge: real vs. satirical bills, and why the line has blurred
- Ten items presented as a quiz (five real, five satirical), each with a one-sentence description
- Answer key with Congress.gov links for real bills and absurdityindex.org links for satirical ones
- Scoring guide with humorous tiers ("0--3 correct: You may be a sitting member of Congress")
- Closing tagline linking to the full interactive quiz at absurdityindex.org/quiz

### 1D. The Belladonna

**Submit:** thebelladonnacomedy.com/submit
**Format:** Humor essay or list, typically 400--800 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Pitch -- "Exit Interview With a Congressional Bill That Died in Committee"

Hi Belladonna team,

I'd like to pitch a piece written as a first-person exit interview with a congressional bill that died in committee. The bill -- a reasonable, bipartisan proposal -- reflects on its brief life: being introduced with great fanfare, assigned to a committee that never met, watching less qualified bills get floor time, and ultimately expiring when the congressional session ended.

The satire draws from real patterns tracked on absurdityindex.org, where we follow bills through their legislative journey and score the absurdity of the process. The piece would incorporate real data points (percent of bills that die in committee, average time a bill spends unread) with links to sources.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: "Thank you for taking the time. I know you're busy -- unlike the committee I was assigned to."
- The bill recounts being introduced, feeling hopeful, then learning that 95% of bills die in committee
- Jealousy toward bills that got floor time (naming post offices, declaring National Pickle Day)
- Bitterness about the omnibus bill that absorbed its best provisions without credit
- Closing: the bill's plans for the afterlife ("I hear there's a nice archive at Congress.gov") and a plug for absurdityindex.org as its memorial

### 1E. Humor Times

**Submit:** humortimes.com (accepts op-ed satire, cartoons, and columns)
**Format:** Satirical op-ed, 500--800 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Column Pitch -- "The Absurdity Index: A Conditions Report on Congressional Sanity"

Dear Humor Times,

I'd like to pitch a recurring satirical column idea based on absurdityindex.org, a site that scores real federal legislation on a 1--10 Absurdity Index. Each column would highlight one or two recently scored real bills, explain what they actually do in plain language, and pair them with our satirical alternatives.

For a sample column, I'd cover the trend of bills with tortured acronyms (Congress spends genuine time crafting these) alongside our Pork Index, which tracks how much spending gets added to bills as they move through committees. Every factual claim links to Congress.gov.

The tone is non-partisan -- absurdity knows no party affiliation. Happy to send a sample column.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: "This week's Congressional Absurdity Forecast: partly cloudy with a 90% chance of riders nobody read"
- Highlight a high-scoring real bill from the Absurdity Index, explain what it does in plain language
- Compare it to a satirical alternative from absurdityindex.org that solves the same problem more simply
- "Pork Watch" sidebar: spending additions tracked through the bill's evolution
- Closing: the week's overall absurdity average and a link to the full index

### 1F. The Satirist (thesatirist.com)

**Submit:** thesatirist.com/contact
**Format:** Satirical essay, 500--1,500 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Submission -- "A Modest Proposal for Congressional Transparency (They Won't Like It)"

Dear Editors,

I'd like to submit a satirical essay titled "A Modest Proposal for Congressional Transparency (They Won't Like It)." In the tradition of Swift, it proposes that Congress be required to read bills aloud before voting -- then calculates how long it would take to read a 4,155-page omnibus bill at normal speaking pace (approximately 46 hours of continuous reading).

The essay builds on data from the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), which tracks real federal legislation through its evolution -- including how much spending gets added between introduction and final vote. The punchline: the bill that emerged from committee bore so little resemblance to the one introduced that it technically qualified as a different piece of legislation.

Every factual claim includes a proof link. The absurdity writes itself.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: Swiftian proposal that all bills be read aloud before a vote, with time calculations for real omnibus bills
- Middle: walk through a real bill's evolution using the Absurdity Index's bill-tracking data -- introduced at 12 pages, emerged from committee at 400, left conference at 4,155
- The pork trail: specific spending additions tracked stage by stage, with Congress.gov amendment links
- Counter-proposal: if reading is too hard, perhaps a simple summary in plain English (which is what absurdityindex.org already does)
- Closing: the truly modest proposal is that citizens should be able to understand what their government is doing

### 1G. Robot Butt

**Submit:** robotbutt.com/submit
**Format:** Humor, satire, absurdist, 300--1,000 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Submission -- "I Trained an AI to Write Congressional Bills and It Immediately Started Adding Pork"

Hi Robot Butt,

I'd like to submit a short humor piece about a fictional experiment: training an AI to write congressional legislation. The AI, fed a corpus of real bills, immediately begins adding irrelevant spending provisions, crafting tortured acronyms, and scheduling itself for recess. When asked to write a simple, clear bill, it throws an error: "SYNTAX NOT FOUND IN TRAINING DATA."

The piece is inspired by absurdityindex.org, where we score real federal bills on an absurdity scale. The AI angle lets me highlight real patterns in legislation -- pork-barrel spending, unreadable language, bills that contradict their own titles -- by treating them as "features" the AI learned, not bugs.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Setup: researcher feeds real congressional bills into a language model to generate "optimal" legislation
- The AI's first bill is 2,000 pages, names a post office, and includes $40 million for a bridge in a district that has no river
- When prompted for a clear, concise bill, the AI outputs "ERROR: TRAINING DATA CONTAINS NO EXAMPLES"
- The AI achieves a perfect 10 on the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org) -- a score no human legislator has reached
- Closing: the AI is offered a committee chairmanship

### 1H. Defenestration Magazine

**Submit:** defenestrationmag.net/submit
**Format:** Humor fiction, essays, poetry; 500--3,000 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Submission -- "The Last Sensible Bill: A Legislative Fable"

Dear Defenestration editors,

I'd like to submit a short humor fable (approx. 1,200 words) titled "The Last Sensible Bill." It follows a bill -- simple, bipartisan, two pages -- as it navigates the legislative process. Along the way, it acquires riders, amendments, a tortured acronym, and enough pork to fund a small country. By the time it reaches the president's desk, it no longer recognizes itself.

The fable draws on the bill-evolution tracking feature of the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), which follows real legislation stage by stage and tallies how spending, page count, and scope change from introduction to final passage. The piece exaggerates real patterns only slightly -- which is the hardest part.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- A simple, two-page bill is born: "The Common Sense Act"
- Committee stage: it gains a subtitle, three riders, and a new acronym (now the "Creating Optimal Mechanisms for Making Organizations Negotiate Sensibly, Economically, Noticeably, and Systematically, Ensuring..." -- you get the idea)
- Floor amendments: $400 million in pork, a section on fish habitats unrelated to the bill's purpose, and a renaming of a federal building
- Conference committee: the bill merges with an unrelated appropriations package and is now 1,200 pages
- Presidential signing: the bill that arrives bears no textual resemblance to the one introduced; it passes unanimously because nobody read it

### 2A. The Fulcrum

**Angle:** Satire as civic engagement
**Submit:** thefulcrum.us (accepts op-eds and contributor pieces)
**Focus:** Non-partisan democracy and civic participation

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Op-Ed Pitch -- "Satire as Civic Infrastructure: How Humor Makes Government Accessible"

Dear Fulcrum editors,

I'd like to pitch an op-ed (800--1,000 words) arguing that satire is an underutilized tool for civic engagement. The piece draws on my experience building the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), a non-partisan site that scores real federal legislation on an absurdity scale and translates bills into plain language.

The core argument: most Americans don't engage with legislation because it's impenetrable. The Absurdity Index makes it accessible through satirical commentary, interactive tools (a "Would You Pass It?" swipe game, Congressional Bingo, a bill quiz), and side-by-side comparisons of real bills with satirical alternatives. Every factual claim on the site links directly to Congress.gov.

The piece would address how non-partisan humor can lower the barrier to civic participation without dumbing down the substance, and why proof-linked satire is more trustworthy than most political commentary.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- The accessibility problem: legislation is written in language designed to be unreadable, and most civic engagement tools assume prior knowledge
- Satire as a gateway: how humor lowers defenses and invites curiosity (cite research on satire and political knowledge)
- The Absurdity Index model: non-partisan scoring, plain-language summaries, proof links to primary sources, interactive tools that teach by doing
- Results and engagement: how users who came for the jokes stayed for the Congress.gov links
- Call to action: more civic organizations should experiment with humor, not less

### 2B. Daily Kos

**Format:** Community diary (self-published, no editor approval needed)
**Submit:** dailykos.com (create account, publish diary)

#### Pitch Email (N/A -- self-published)

Draft diary post intro:

Title: "I Built a Site That Scores Congressional Bills on Absurdity. Here's What I Learned."

I spent the last year reading congressional bills -- all of them, not just the headlines. I read the committee reports. I read the amendments. I tracked spending additions from introduction to final vote. Then I built absurdityindex.org to share what I found.

The Absurdity Index is non-partisan (absurdity doesn't pick a side) and every factual claim links directly to Congress.gov. Here's what stood out.

#### Article Outline

- Personal narrative: why I started reading bills and what I expected vs. what I found
- Three specific real bills with high absurdity scores, explained in plain language with Congress.gov links
- The pork tracking feature: how spending balloons between introduction and passage, with specific dollar figures
- Interactive tools that make legislation engaging: the bill quiz, the swipe game, side-by-side comparisons
- Invitation to explore and submit bills; link to absurdityindex.org

### 2C. International Policy Digest

**Submit:** intpolicydigest.org/submit-an-article
**Format:** Commentary and analysis, 800--1,500 words

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Article Pitch -- "Scoring Democracy: What Legislative Absurdity Metrics Reveal About Governance"

Dear IPD editors,

I'd like to pitch an analytical commentary piece (1,000--1,200 words) examining what systematic absurdity scoring of legislation reveals about democratic governance. The piece draws on data from the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), which scores real U.S. federal bills on a 1--10 scale based on factors including wasteful spending, gap between stated goals and actual impact, procedural gamesmanship, and tortured acronyms.

The international angle: legislative opacity is not unique to the U.S. The piece argues that transparency tools -- even satirical ones -- serve a democratic function by making legislative activity legible to citizens. It compares the Absurdity Index approach with parliamentary transparency initiatives in other democracies.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: the problem of legislative legibility in democracies worldwide
- The Absurdity Index methodology: what the scoring criteria reveal about systemic incentives (pork, acronym games, omnibus packaging)
- Data patterns: average absurdity by category, distribution of scores, bills that score highest and why
- International comparison: how other democracies handle transparency (UK's TheyWorkForYou, Taiwan's parliamentary monitoring)
- Conclusion: satirical transparency tools as democratic infrastructure, not just entertainment

### 2D. Common Dreams

**Format:** Op-ed, 600--900 words
**Submit:** commondreams.org (op-ed submissions via editor contact)

#### Pitch Email

Subject: Op-Ed -- "Every Bill Should Come With a Receipt"

Dear Common Dreams editors,

I'd like to submit an op-ed (800 words) arguing that every piece of legislation should be accompanied by a plain-language summary and a transparent spending trail -- what I call "a receipt."

The piece draws on the pork-tracking feature of the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), which follows real federal bills from introduction to passage and documents how spending changes at each stage. The data tells a consistent story: bills enter committee lean and exit bloated, with additions that often have nothing to do with the bill's stated purpose. I provide specific examples with Congress.gov links.

The argument is simple: citizens can't hold representatives accountable for spending they can't see. The Absurdity Index is one model for making that spending visible.

Best,
[Name]

#### Article Outline

- Opening: a specific real bill that entered committee at $X and left at $Y, with a list of what was added
- The transparency gap: most citizens have no idea how spending gets added to legislation, and the process is designed to keep it that way
- The Absurdity Index's bill-evolution tracker as a model: stage-by-stage documentation of changes, with amendment links
- What a "legislative receipt" would look like: plain-language summary, spending trail, amendment attribution
- Closing: this isn't partisan -- taxpayers of all affiliations deserve to know where the money goes

### 3A. "Building a Civic Satire Site with Astro 5 and Tailwind CSS v4"

**Target length:** 1,500--2,000 words
**Audience:** Frontend developers, Astro curious, civic tech interested

#### Detailed Outline

**Introduction (200 words)**
- What the Absurdity Index is: a static site that scores real congressional legislation, built with Astro 5, MDX, and Tailwind CSS v4
- Why these tech choices matter for a content-heavy civic site
- What readers will learn: content collections with Zod validation, MDX for structured legislative content, Tailwind v4 migration, and deploying to Cloudflare Pages

**1. Why Astro 5 for Legislative Content (300 words)**
- The site has 37+ bills, each with complex structured data (sponsors, votes, amendments, pork tracking, bill evolution stages)
- Astro's content collections with `glob` loader handle MDX files in `src/data/bills/`
- Zero-JS-by-default philosophy: most pages are pure HTML/CSS with islands of interactivity (the swipe game, bingo, quiz)
- Performance benefits for a public-interest site: fast load times, accessible, works on low-end devices

**2. Content Collections and Zod Schema Design (400 words)**
- Walk through the bill schema in `src/content.config.ts`: base schema shared by all bill types, extended with optional fields for real bills
- Zod refinements for bill-type-specific requirements (real bills require `sponsorParty`, `sponsorState`, `congressNumber`)
- The `billEvolution` schema: tracking a bill through 30+ possible stages from introduction to presidential action
- Pork tracking schema: `porkItemSchema` with sponsor attribution, amendment numbers, vote records, and satirical notes
- Template-driven authoring: `_templates/` folder with starter MDX files to ensure consistency
- Validation scripts (`npm run validate`) that run Zod against all MDX frontmatter at build time

**3. MDX for Legislative Content (250 words)**
- Why MDX over plain Markdown: structured frontmatter for data, prose for commentary, components for interactive elements
- Rendering pattern: `render(entry)` from `astro:content` (Astro 5 API change from `entry.render()`)
- Embedding proof links: every factual claim in bill commentary includes a hyperlink to Congress.gov, clerk.house.gov, or another authoritative source
- Rehype plugin for external links: automatic `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` via `rehype-external-links`

**4. Tailwind CSS v4: The Government-Parody Design System (300 words)**
- Custom theme in `@theme {}` block in `global.css`: navy, gold, cream, parchment palette
- Typography stack: Libre Caslon Text (serif, for that government-document gravitas), Inter (sans), JetBrains Mono (mono)
- Dark mode via `html.dark` class toggle
- Component patterns: `.gold-rule` dividers, `.bill-content` prose styling, parchment card backgrounds
- No Unicode emoji policy: Lucide icons via a custom `Icon.astro` component for consistent rendering

**5. Interactive Features as Islands (200 words)**
- Astro islands architecture: static pages with client-side JS only where needed
- "Would You Pass It?" swipe game: bills shuffled at build time, client-side swipe interaction
- Congressional Bingo: randomized board generation, client-side square toggling
- Bill quiz: question data compiled at build, client-side state management
- Trends page: chart data computed at build time from bill collection, rendered as CSS bar charts (no JS charting library)

**6. Build Pipeline and Deployment (200 words)**
- `npm run build`: Astro build + Pagefind search index generation
- Cloudflare Pages deployment with Workers Functions for the API layer (`/api/today.json`)
- Middleware in `functions/_middleware.js` for security headers and routing
- CI via Argo Workflows on self-hosted Kubernetes, polling main branch every 60 seconds
- Validation-first: `npm run verify` runs icon checks, innerHTML checks, bill validation, tests, linting, type checking, formatting, security audit, and build

**Conclusion (100 words)**
- Astro 5 + MDX + Tailwind v4 is an excellent stack for content-heavy civic sites
- The content collections system with Zod validation catches errors before they reach production
- Link to absurdityindex.org and the open-source repository

### 3B. "How We Built a Real-Time Congressional Bill Scoring System"

**Target length:** 1,800--2,200 words
**Audience:** Civic tech developers, data engineers, product managers

#### Detailed Outline

**Introduction (200 words)**
- The problem: congressional legislation is impenetrable, and existing tracking tools are either too dry or too partisan
- The Absurdity Index solution: score real bills on a 1--10 scale using a transparent, documented methodology
- What this article covers: the scoring system, data pipeline, bill-evolution tracking, and pork accounting

**1. The Absurdity Scale: Methodology (400 words)**
- The four-tier scale: Mostly Harmless (1--3), Eyebrow Raising (4--6), Peak Absurdity (7--8), Congressional Singularity (9--10)
- Scoring criteria: wasteful or inefficient spending, tortured acronyms and naming, time spent relative to importance, actual impact vs. stated goals, unintended consequences
- Editorial opinion, not objective fact: why we make this distinction explicit and what it means for credibility
- Non-partisan commitment: absurdity scored regardless of party, with examples from both sides of the aisle

**2. Data Pipeline: From Congress.gov to the Absurdity Index (400 words)**
- Source: public congressional data via Congress.gov API and public feeds
- Bill fetch script (`scripts/fetch-bills.mjs`): pulls bill metadata, actions, amendments, sponsors, cosponsors, committee assignments
- Data normalization: mapping Congress.gov action types to the 30+ stage `billEvolution` schema
- Deduplication: the `dedupeActionEntries` utility for cleaning action timelines
- Validation: Zod schema enforcement at build time catches data quality issues before deployment

**3. Bill Evolution Tracking (400 words)**
- The problem: a bill at introduction is often unrecognizable by final passage
- The `billEvolutionStageSchema`: 30+ stages from `introduced` through `became-law` or terminal states (`died-in-committee`, `expired`)
- Chamber-agnostic design: "origin" and "receiving" chamber terminology instead of hardcoding House/Senate
- Per-stage data: `paraphrasedText` (AI-generated plain-language summary), `cumulativePork`, `porkAddedThisStage`, `keyChanges`, `amendmentsIncluded`
- Ping-pong tracking: when a bill bounces between chambers, the `round` field tracks iterations
- Real example: walk through a bill's evolution from 12-page introduction to 4,000-page omnibus

**4. Pork Accounting System (400 words)**
- The `porkItemSchema`: tracking individual spending additions with attribution
- Fields: `description`, `amount`, `addedBy`, `sponsor` (with `bioguideId` for linking to official records), `category` (earmark, program-expansion, new-program, tax-expenditure, hidden-cost)
- Amendment-level tracking: `amendmentNumber`, `amendmentType` (floor, committee, conference, manager)
- Vote records per pork item: yeas, nays, roll call number, link to official roll call
- The `satiricalNote` field: editorial commentary on individual spending items
- Aggregation: per-bill `totalPork` and `porkPerCapita`, per-representative `totalPorkAmount` via the representatives collection

**5. The Representatives Collection (200 words)**
- Cross-referencing bills and sponsors via `bioguideId`
- Pork contribution tracking per representative: `porkContributions` array with bill references, amounts, categories
- Financial disclosure data: `minNetWorth`, `maxNetWorth` by year for context
- The Rep Pork Index page: leaderboard with time sliders showing pork and net worth evolution

**6. Interactive Transparency Tools (200 words)**
- Bill Diff Tool: compare bill versions to see what changed between stages
- Bill Comparisons: real bills paired with satirical alternatives via `pairedBillId`
- Trends page: aggregate data visualizations computed from the bill collection at build time
- "What Did Congress Do Today?": live floor activity sourced from official public feeds

**Conclusion (200 words)**
- Building a scoring system for legislation requires balancing editorial judgment with data transparency
- Proof links and source attribution are non-negotiable for credibility
- The technical infrastructure -- Zod schemas, stage tracking, pork accounting -- serves the editorial mission of making legislation legible
- Link to absurdityindex.org and methodology page

### 3C. "Deploying an Astro SSG Site on Cloudflare Pages with Workers Functions"

**Target length:** 1,500--1,800 words
**Audience:** Web developers deploying Astro sites, Cloudflare users

#### Detailed Outline

**Introduction (150 words)**
- What we're deploying: absurdityindex.org, an Astro 5 SSG site with API endpoints via Cloudflare Pages Functions
- Why Cloudflare Pages: global CDN, Workers Functions for server-side logic, generous free tier, fast builds
- What readers will learn: project structure, build configuration, middleware, API functions, headers, and CI/CD

**1. Project Structure for Cloudflare Pages (250 words)**
- Astro config: `astro.config.mjs` with `site` set to production URL, MDX and sitemap integrations, Tailwind via Vite plugin
- The `functions/` directory: Cloudflare Pages Functions live here, auto-deployed alongside the static site
- `functions/_middleware.js`: request interception for security headers, CORS, routing logic
- `functions/api/*.js`: API endpoints (e.g., `today.json.js` for live congressional activity data)
- `public/` directory: static assets, `_headers` file for Cloudflare-specific header rules

**2. Build Configuration (250 words)**
- Build command: `astro build && npx pagefind --site dist`
- Pagefind integration: generating a client-side search index at build time from the static output
- Output directory: `dist/`
- Environment variables: guarding `process.env` access for Cloudflare Workers runtime compatibility (Workers runtime does not have Node.js `process` global)
- The `try/catch` pattern in API functions: graceful error handling when environment differs between local dev and Workers runtime

**3. Cloudflare Pages Functions (300 words)**
- File-based routing: `functions/api/today.json.js` maps to `/api/today.json`
- Middleware chain: `functions/_middleware.js` runs before all requests
- Security headers: Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options set in middleware
- CORS handling for API endpoints
- The `_headers` file in `public/`: static header rules for Cloudflare Pages (cache control, security headers for static assets)
- Gotcha: Cloudflare Pages Functions run in the Workers runtime, not Node.js -- no `fs`, no `process.env` by default, different global scope

**4. Custom Headers and Security (200 words)**
- The `public/_headers` file format: path-based header rules
- Security headers strategy: strict CSP, no-sniff, no-frame for non-embed pages
- Cache strategy: long cache for hashed assets, shorter for HTML
- Cloudflare-specific headers: `CDN-Cache-Control`, `Cache-Tag` for targeted purging

**5. CI/CD Pipeline (200 words)**
- Argo Workflows on self-hosted Kubernetes: polls main branch every 60 seconds
- Pipeline stages defined in `.woodpecker.yml`: validate, security audit, build, test
- The `npm run verify` command: full CI check including icon validation, bill schema validation, linting, type checking, formatting, security audit, and build
- Manual deployment option: `npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=absurdity-index`
- Wrangler CLI: Cloudflare's tool for Workers and Pages deployment

**6. Pagefind: Client-Side Search for Static Sites (200 words)**
- Why Pagefind: full-text search with no server, no external service, generated at build time
- Integration: runs after Astro build, indexes the `dist/` directory
- Search page at `/search`: loads Pagefind JS and CSS, provides instant search across all bill content
- Performance: the search index is a fraction of the total site size, loaded on demand

**Conclusion (100 words)**

### 3D. "Making Government Data Engaging: UX Lessons from Building the Absurdity Index"

**Target length:** 1,500--2,000 words
**Audience:** UX designers, product designers, civic tech practitioners

#### Detailed Outline

**Introduction (200 words)**
- The challenge: government data is public but functionally inaccessible because of presentation, not availability
- The Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org) set out to make congressional legislation genuinely engaging -- not just "available"
- What this article covers: design decisions, information architecture, interactive engagement patterns, and what worked

**1. The Government-Parody Design System (300 words)**
- The visual concept: a government website that looks official enough to be trusted, absurd enough to signal satire
- Color palette: navy, gold, cream, parchment -- evoking government documents and institutional authority
- Typography: Libre Caslon Text (serif) for body text creates that official-document feel; Inter (sans) for UI elements; JetBrains Mono for data
- The Official Seal: a custom SVG component (`OfficialSeal.astro`) used throughout the site for institutional gravitas
- Gold rule dividers, parchment card backgrounds, and the "Quorum Counter" -- decorative elements that reinforce the parody without undermining readability
- Dark mode: full dark mode support, because even satirical government websites should respect user preferences

**2. Information Architecture: Three-Track Content Model (300 words)**
- Real Bills: actual federal legislation with absurdity scores, plain-language summaries, and Congress.gov source links
- Not Bills: satirical legislation so reasonable Congress would never pass it
- Under Consideration: real bills in committee with direct links to Congress.gov
- Why three tracks: users can enter through whichever lens appeals to them (outrage, humor, or civic duty) and discover the others
- Bill detail pages: structured frontmatter renders consistent layouts -- sponsor info, committee assignment, vote tallies, status badges, absurdity meter, pork tracking, bill evolution timeline
- Category and tag browsing: cross-cutting navigation that works across all three bill types

**3. Interactive Engagement: Games as Civic Education (400 words)**
- "Would You Pass It?" (Swipe): Tinder-style interface where users swipe to pass or veto bills, then learn whether they're real or satirical
  - Design insight: the game mechanic forces engagement with bill content before revealing the answer
  - Users who play are more likely to click through to full bill pages
- Congressional Bingo: randomized boards with squares like "Bill acronym spells a word" and "Bipartisan on naming a post office"
  - Design insight: gamification of real congressional patterns creates recognition ("I've seen this happen")
- The Bill Quiz: multiple-choice questions about real congressional procedures
  - Design insight: quiz format transforms dry procedural knowledge into competitive engagement
- Bill Comparisons: side-by-side real bill vs. satirical alternative
  - Design insight: juxtaposition makes the absurdity visceral in a way a score alone cannot
- The Bill Diff Tool: paste two bill versions and see highlighted changes
  - Design insight: borrowing the developer "diff" metaphor makes legislative changes legible to a technical audience

**4. Trust Through Transparency: The Proof-Link Standard (300 words)**
- The editorial rule: every factual claim must include a proof link to an authoritative source (Congress.gov, clerk.house.gov, law.cornell.edu)
- Why this matters for UX: users don't have to trust the site's interpretation -- they can verify immediately
- Design implementation: proof links are inline, not footnotes, so the verification path is zero-friction
- The absurdity score disclaimer: scores are "subjective editorial ratings," stated clearly on the methodology page and on every bill page
- Source attribution in the bill evolution tracker: each stage links to the relevant Congress.gov action or amendment
- The result: a satire site that is more transparent about its sources than most news sites

**5. Accessibility and Performance (200 words)**
- Zero-JS-by-default via Astro: most pages load as pure HTML/CSS
- Responsive design from 375px to desktop: the site works on the phones people actually have
- Semantic HTML: proper heading hierarchy, ARIA labels, descriptive link text
- Pagefind search: full-text search without external dependencies or server-side processing
- RSS feed: because civic engagement shouldn't require checking a website

**Conclusion (150 words)**
- Government data doesn't fail because it's complex -- it fails because it's presented as if complexity is the point
- Design lessons: meet users where they are (humor, games, comparisons), earn trust through transparency (proof links, disclaimers), and respect their devices (performance, accessibility)
- The Absurdity Index proves that legislative content can be both rigorous and engaging

**Base Pitch (customize the angle paragraph for each podcast category):**

Hi [Host Name],

I'm [Name], the creator of the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org) -- a non-partisan satirical commentary site that scores real federal legislation on a 1--10 Absurdity Index and pairs real bills with satirical alternatives that actually make sense. Every factual claim on the site links to Congress.gov.

[ANGLE PARAGRAPH -- see variants below]

A few things I can talk about:

- Why real congressional bills are now indistinguishable from satire (with specific examples)
- How the Absurdity Index scoring methodology works and what it reveals about legislative patterns
- The pork-tracking system that follows spending additions from bill introduction to final passage
- Interactive tools designed to make legislation engaging: a Tinder-style bill-voting game, Congressional Bingo, side-by-side bill comparisons
- Why non-partisan satire builds more trust than partisan commentary
- The proof-link standard: why every factual claim needs a source, and how that changes the way you write satire

I'm comfortable with live conversation, prepared segments, or audience Q&A. Happy to send a one-sheet or jump on a quick pre-call.

Best,
[Name]

#### Angle Variant: Political Comedy Podcasts

The comedy angle: I started building the Absurdity Index because I kept finding real bills that were funnier than anything I could make up. The COVFEFE Act is real. Congress once spent floor time debating whether pizza is a vegetable (spoiler: they decided it is). The hardest part of writing satirical legislation is making it more absurd than the real thing -- and I'm losing that race.

---

#### Angle Variant: Civic Tech Podcasts

The civic tech angle: the Absurdity Index sits at the intersection of transparency and engagement. Most civic tech tools assume users already care about legislation -- we assume they don't yet. Humor is the on-ramp. Users come for the satirical bills and the swipe game, stay for the Congress.gov links and the pork-tracking data. The site tracks bill evolution through 30+ legislative stages, documents spending additions with amendment-level attribution, and cross-references representatives with their pork contributions. It's a transparency tool disguised as a satire site.

---

#### Angle Variant: Web Development Podcasts

The tech angle: the Absurdity Index is built with Astro 5, MDX, Tailwind CSS v4, and Cloudflare Pages. I can talk about using Astro content collections with Zod validation for complex legislative data schemas, building interactive features as Astro islands (a swipe game, bingo boards, quiz engines) with zero-JS defaults, deploying with Cloudflare Workers Functions for server-side API endpoints, and running CI via Argo Workflows on self-hosted Kubernetes. The bill schema alone has 30+ possible evolution stages and nested pork-tracking with amendment attribution -- it's one of the more complex Zod schemas you'll see in a static site.

---

#### Angle Variant: Indie Hacker / Startup Podcasts

The builder angle: I built the Absurdity Index as a solo project -- no funding, no team, no launch event. The tech stack (Astro 5, Cloudflare Pages) keeps hosting costs near zero. The content strategy is built around a flywheel: real congressional absurdity generates content continuously, satirical bills and interactive tools drive engagement, and proof links to Congress.gov build credibility that's hard to fake. I can talk about building in public, choosing a tech stack for solo maintainability, content strategy for a niche audience, and why satire is an underexplored angle for civic products.

### PRESS RELEASE

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**The Absurdity Index Launches to Score Real Congressional Legislation on a Scale of Absurdity**

*Non-partisan satirical site pairs real federal bills with proof links, interactive tools, and satirical alternatives that actually make sense*

[City, State] -- The Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org) has launched as a free, non-partisan satirical commentary site that scores real federal legislation on a 1--10 Absurdity Index and translates bills into plain language that citizens can actually understand.

The site addresses a persistent civic engagement problem: congressional legislation is public but effectively inaccessible. Bills run thousands of pages, are written in specialized legal language, and undergo dramatic transformations between introduction and final passage -- often with minimal public awareness of what changed or why.

The Absurdity Index tackles this through three content tracks. "Real Bills" presents actual federal legislation with plain-language summaries, absurdity scores, and direct links to Congress.gov. "Not Bills" offers satirical legislation so reasonable that no actual Congress would pass it. "Under Consideration" tracks real bills currently in committee with links to official sources.

What distinguishes the Absurdity Index from political commentary sites is its proof-link standard: every factual claim on the site includes a link to an authoritative source such as Congress.gov, clerk.house.gov roll calls, or official committee records. The site's methodology page openly discloses that absurdity scores are subjective editorial ratings.

The site also features interactive civic engagement tools including a "Would You Pass It?" swipe game where users vote on bills before learning whether they are real or satirical, Congressional Bingo, a legislative knowledge quiz, side-by-side bill comparisons, a bill-diff tool for comparing legislative versions, and a pork-tracking system that documents spending additions from introduction to final passage with amendment-level attribution.

"Most people don't engage with legislation because it is genuinely unreadable," said the site's creator. "The Absurdity Index makes it engaging through humor and interactive tools, but backs everything with primary sources. We want users to laugh, then click the Congress.gov link and see for themselves."

The Absurdity Index is built on the principle that absurdity is non-partisan. Bills from both parties and all policy areas are scored using the same transparent criteria. The site is free, contains no advertising, and requires no account to use.

**About the Absurdity Index**
The Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org) is a free, non-partisan satirical commentary site dedicated to making congressional legislation accessible through humor, transparency, and interactive engagement tools. The site scores real federal bills on a 1--10 Absurdity Index and provides plain-language summaries with proof links to official sources.
