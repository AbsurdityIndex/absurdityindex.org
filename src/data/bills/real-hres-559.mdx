## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 559 expressed the sense of the House of Representatives that the House gym should be closed during any lapse in appropriations (government shutdown). The resolution was introduced during the October 2013 government shutdown, when approximately 800,000 federal employees were furloughed without pay.

## Bill Details

During the 2013 shutdown, the congressional gym — a taxpayer-funded facility available exclusively to members of Congress — remained open. This became a symbol of congressional privilege while national parks closed, Head Start programs shut down, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers went without paychecks.

The gym includes:
- Swimming pool
- Sauna and steam room
- Paddleball court
- Basketball court
- Full weight room
- Cardiovascular equipment
- Locker rooms with towel service

The facility operates at an estimated cost of over $1 million per year. When asked about it, several members expressed surprise that it had remained open.

## The Optics Problem

The resolution was straightforward: if the government is shut down, Congress doesn't get to work out on the taxpayer's dime. Despite its common-sense appeal, the resolution never received a vote.

Rep. Bill Foster, a physicist and the only research scientist in Congress at the time, introduced the resolution with three cosponsors. Their argument was simple: if federal workers are furloughed without pay, members of Congress shouldn't be enjoying taxpayer-funded amenities.

The resolution was referred to the House Administration Committee — the committee that oversees House operations, including the gym. Unsurprisingly, the committee did not act on a resolution that would restrict its own members' privileges.

## A Pattern

The gym remained open during subsequent government shutdowns as well, including the 35-day shutdown from December 2018 to January 2019 — the longest in U.S. history. While 800,000 federal workers went without pay, members of Congress could still enjoy the pool.

Congressional pay also continued during shutdowns, adding to the perception that Congress insulated itself from the consequences of its own dysfunction.
