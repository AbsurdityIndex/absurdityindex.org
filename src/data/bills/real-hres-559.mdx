## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 559 expressed the sense of the House of Representatives that the House gym should be closed during any lapse in appropriations (government shutdown). The resolution was introduced during the October 2013 government shutdown, when approximately 800,000 federal employees were furloughed without pay.

## Bill Details

During the 2013 shutdown, the congressional gym — a taxpayer-funded facility available exclusively to members of Congress — remained open. This became a symbol of congressional privilege while national parks closed, Head Start programs shut down, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers went without paychecks.

The gym includes a pool, sauna, and paddleball court, and operates at an estimated cost of over $1 million per year. When asked about it, several members expressed surprise that it had remained open. The resolution was straightforward: if the government is shut down, Congress doesn't get to work out on the taxpayer's dime. Despite its common-sense appeal, the resolution never received a vote. The gym remained open during subsequent shutdowns as well.
