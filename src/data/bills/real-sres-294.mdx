## Congressional Research Service Summary

Senate Resolution 294 designated September 2007 as National Bourbon Heritage Month. The resolution recognized bourbon whiskey as a distinctive product of the United States, noting that Congress had already declared bourbon as "America's Native Spirit" in a 1964 concurrent resolution.

## Bill Details

The resolution passed the Senate by unanimous consent, meaning not a single senator objected to giving bourbon its own month. It cited bourbon's economic importance — particularly to Kentucky, which produces 95% of the world's bourbon supply — and its cultural significance in American history.

The resolution specifically noted that:
- Bourbon has been recognized as a "distinctive product of the United States" since 1964
- The bourbon industry generates over $1.8 billion annually
- Kentucky alone is home to over 5 million barrels of aging bourbon
- Bourbon production supports thousands of jobs in rural America

## The Bourbon Facts

Bourbon must meet specific legal requirements to earn the name:
- Made in the United States (though not required to be made in Kentucky)
- At least 51% corn in the grain mixture
- Aged in new, charred oak barrels
- Distilled to no more than 160 proof
- Entered into the barrel at no more than 125 proof

This is one of hundreds of commemorative resolutions Congress passes each year. There is a National Catfish Month, a National Pi Day, and many more. These resolutions are non-binding and carry no force of law, but they do consume floor time in the world's greatest deliberative body. At least this one celebrates something most senators can actually agree on.
