## What This Bill Actually Does

The FY2012 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act became infamous not for what it funded, but for what it blocked. Hidden among 400+ pages of spending provisions was language that prevented the USDA from implementing updated nutrition standards for school meals.

The USDA had proposed requiring half a cup of tomato paste to count as a vegetable serving (up from two tablespoons). The frozen pizza industry lobbied heavily against the change, arguing it would increase costs. Congress sided with the pizza lobby.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 - Division A: Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2012 - Makes appropriations for FY2012 for the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. Includes provisions affecting school meal nutrition standards.

## Bill Text Excerpt

**SEC. 743.** None of the funds made available by this Act may be used to implement proposed regulations relating to nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program published by the Department of Agriculture in the Federal Register on January 13, 2011 (76 Fed. Reg. 2494), that would limit the serving of potatoes or require increases in tomato paste requirements.

## The Pizza Lobby

In 2011, the USDA proposed new rules to improve school lunch nutrition, including limiting potatoes, increasing whole grains, and requiring more tomato paste to count as a vegetable. The frozen food industry, particularly companies producing school-lunch pizzas, lobbied heavily against the changes.

The American Frozen Food Institute and Schwan Food Company spent over $5.6 million lobbying Congress that year. Their message: the proposed rules would increase costs for schools and waste food. Congress responded by inserting language into the appropriations bill that preserved the existing standard.

The result: a slice of pizza with two tablespoons of tomato sauce continued to count as a vegetable serving under federal school lunch guidelines. While technically Congress never declared "pizza is a vegetable," the practical effect of blocking the USDA's reforms was exactly that.
