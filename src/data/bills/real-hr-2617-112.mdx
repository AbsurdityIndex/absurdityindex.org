## Congressional Research Service Summary

The FY2012 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act included a provision in its agriculture section that blocked proposed USDA nutritional reforms for school lunches. The USDA had proposed requiring half a cup of tomato paste to count as a vegetable serving (up from two tablespoons). Congress overrode this, keeping the existing standard in place.

## Bill Details

In 2011, the USDA proposed new rules to improve school lunch nutrition, including limiting potatoes, increasing whole grains, and requiring more tomato paste to count as a vegetable. The frozen food industry — particularly companies producing school-lunch pizzas — lobbied heavily against the changes. Congress responded by inserting language into the appropriations bill that preserved the existing standard.

The result: a slice of pizza with two tablespoons of tomato sauce continued to count as a vegetable serving under federal school lunch guidelines. While technically Congress never declared "pizza is a vegetable," the practical effect of blocking the USDA's reforms was exactly that. The episode became a symbol of food-industry lobbying power and was widely ridiculed in the press.
