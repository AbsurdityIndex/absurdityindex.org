## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill would make daylight saving time permanent across the United States, eliminating the practice of changing clocks twice per year. The Senate passed a similar version (the Sunshine Protection Act) unanimously in 2022, but it stalled in the House.

## Bill Details

The practice of changing clocks has been debated in Congress repeatedly since the Uniform Time Act of 1966. Multiple versions of this bill have been introduced across several congressional sessions, with broad public support but persistent legislative inaction.
