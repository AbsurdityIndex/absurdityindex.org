## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act proposed establishing the Apollo 11 landing site at Tranquility Base as a National Historical Park managed under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. The bill would also seek to have the site designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## Bill Details

The bill aimed to protect the Apollo landing sites from future disturbance, including by commercial lunar operations. It acknowledged the Outer Space Treaty's prohibition on national sovereignty claims over celestial bodies but argued that protecting historic artifacts (the flag, footprints, equipment) did not constitute a territorial claim.

The legislation raised fascinating legal and practical questions: Can you have a National Park with no rangers, no visitors center, and no atmosphere? How do you enforce "stay on the trail" policies 238,900 miles away? Despite these challenges, the underlying goal of preserving humanity's first steps on another world has genuine merit. The bill never advanced past committee.
