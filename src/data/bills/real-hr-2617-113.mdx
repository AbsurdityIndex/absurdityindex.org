## What This Bill Would Have Done

The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act proposed establishing the Apollo 11 landing site at Tranquility Base as a National Historical Park managed under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior. The bill would also have sought to have the site designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Apollo Lunar Landing Legacy Act would establish the Apollo Lunar Landing Sites National Historical Park on the Moon as a unit of the National Park System. The park would preserve and protect for the benefit of present and future generations the nationally significant historic sites associated with the Apollo 11 mission, including the lunar module descent stage, American flag, and astronaut footprints.

## Bill Details

The bill aimed to protect the Apollo landing sites from future disturbance, including by commercial lunar operations. It acknowledged the Outer Space Treaty's prohibition on national sovereignty claims over celestial bodies but argued that protecting historic artifacts (the flag, footprints, equipment) did not constitute a territorial claim.

The legislation raised fascinating legal and practical questions:
- Can you have a National Park with no rangers, no visitors center, and no atmosphere?
- How do you enforce "stay on the trail" policies 238,900 miles away?
- Does protecting artifacts violate the Outer Space Treaty's sovereignty prohibitions?
- Who would maintain the park, and how?

Despite these challenges, the underlying goal of preserving humanity's first steps on another world has genuine merit. The bill never advanced past committee.

## The Outer Space Treaty Problem

The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which the United States ratified, prohibits national appropriation of celestial bodies by claim of sovereignty. Critics of the bill argued that establishing a U.S. National Park on the Moon could violate this treaty. Supporters countered that protecting artifacts is different from claiming territory.

NASA has since issued voluntary guidelines asking lunar visitors to stay away from the historic landing sites, but these have no legal force. As commercial lunar activities increase, the question of how to protect the Apollo sites remains unresolved.
