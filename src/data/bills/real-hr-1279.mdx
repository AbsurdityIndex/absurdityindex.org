## What This Bill Actually Does

The Sunshine Protection Act would make daylight saving time the permanent standard time for the United States, ending the practice of changing clocks twice per year. The Senate passed an identical bill (S. 582, the Sunshine Protection Act of 2023) in the same Congress, while the Senate had previously passed a similar bill unanimously by voice vote in March 2022, but the House never took it up.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill makes daylight saving time the new, permanent standard time, effectively ending the practice of changing clocks twice per year. States that have already exempted themselves from daylight saving time (Arizona and Hawaii) would not be affected unless they choose to observe the new permanent daylight saving time.

## A Brief History of Time (Zones)

The United States first adopted daylight saving time during World War I to conserve fuel. It was deeply unpopular and repealed after the war. It returned during World War II, was repealed again, and then made permanent (but optional for states) by the Uniform Time Act of 1966.

Since then, Congress has tinkered with DST repeatedly:
- **1974-75**: Extended DST during the energy crisis
- **1986**: Moved start date to first Sunday in April
- **2005**: Extended DST by 4 weeks (Energy Policy Act)

The debate over permanent standard time vs. permanent daylight time continues. Sleep scientists generally favor permanent standard time. The tourism and retail industries favor permanent DST. Congress favors... doing nothing.

## State Action

Nineteen states have passed laws to adopt permanent daylight saving time, but they cannot implement them without federal approval. These states are waiting for Congress to act:

Florida, Washington, California, Oregon, Tennessee, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Delaware, Louisiana, Maine, South Carolina, Georgia, Minnesota, Ohio, Wyoming, Alabama, Colorado, and Kentucky.

Meanwhile, Arizona and Hawaii have opted out of DST entirely and observe permanent standard time.
