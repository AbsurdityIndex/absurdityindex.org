## Congressional Research Service Summary

The PELOSI Act — Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act — would prohibit sitting members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. Members who own stocks at the time of enactment would have six months to divest.

## Bill Details

The bill was introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley and takes direct aim at the broader debate over congressional stock trading. The acronym spells out "PELOSI," a reference to then-former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose household stock trades attracted significant public scrutiny and media coverage.

The underlying policy question of whether lawmakers with access to non-public information should be permitted to trade individual stocks is a genuine bipartisan concern. Multiple bills addressing congressional stock trading have been introduced from both sides of the aisle. But naming this particular bill "PELOSI" added an unmistakable layer of political messaging to the legislation.
