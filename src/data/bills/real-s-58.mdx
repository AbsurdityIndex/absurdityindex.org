## What This Bill Would Have Done

The PELOSI Act, the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act, would prohibit sitting members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. Members who own stocks at the time of enactment would have six months to divest.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

The PELOSI Act would prohibit Members of Congress and their spouses from holding or trading individual stocks. The bill would require divestiture of existing holdings within six months of enactment. Violations would be subject to penalties equal to any trading gains.

## Bill Details

The bill was introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley and takes direct aim at the broader debate over congressional stock trading. The acronym spells out "PELOSI," a reference to then-former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose household stock trades attracted significant public scrutiny and media coverage.

**Key provisions:**
- Complete ban on individual stock ownership for members
- Extends to spouses (addressing the "spouse trading" loophole)
- Six-month window to divest existing holdings
- Penalties equal to trading gains for violations

## The Context

The underlying policy question of whether lawmakers with access to non-public information should be permitted to trade individual stocks is a genuine bipartisan concern. Multiple bills addressing congressional stock trading have been introduced from both sides of the aisle:

- The TRUST in Congress Act (bipartisan)
- The Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act
- The STOCK Act 2.0

But naming this particular bill "PELOSI" added an unmistakable layer of political messaging to the legislation. While polling consistently shows 70%+ public support for banning congressional stock trading, Congress has proven remarkably united in not advancing any of these bills.

## Why It Didn't Pass

The irony of congressional stock trading reform is that the people who would have to vote for it are the same people benefiting from the status quo. The committee with jurisdiction over this bill is composed of members who trade stocks. The Senate majority leader who would schedule a vote trades stocks. The House speaker who would bring it to the floor trades stocks.
