## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill proposes to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, repeal all federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate taxes, and gift taxes, and replace them with a single 23% national retail sales tax. The bill has been introduced in every Congress since 1999.

## Bill Details

The FairTax Act would fundamentally restructure federal revenue collection. Critics argue the 23% rate is calculated "inclusively" and the effective rate would be closer to 30% on a traditional tax-exclusive basis. The bill includes a monthly "prebate" to offset the regressive nature of consumption taxes.
