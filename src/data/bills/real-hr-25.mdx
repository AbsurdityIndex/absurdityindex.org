## What This Bill Actually Does

The FairTax Act would fundamentally restructure how the federal government collects revenue by abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, repealing all federal income taxes, payroll taxes, estate taxes, and gift taxes, and replacing them with a 23% national retail sales tax. States would be responsible for collecting the tax under federal supervision.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill repeals the income tax, employment tax, estate and gift taxes, and replaces them with a national sales tax. It also abolishes the Internal Revenue Service and creates a new Excise Tax Bureau to administer the national sales tax. States would be responsible for collecting the tax under federal supervision.

## The Math Problem

The bill claims a 23% "inclusive" rate, but economists note this is calculated differently from traditional sales tax rates:
- **23% inclusive**: $23 tax on a $100 total purchase (what you pay at the register)
- **30% exclusive**: The same $23 represents 30% of the $77 pre-tax price (traditional calculation)

This is how sales taxes are normally quoted. A 30% sales tax on everything would be the highest in the world.

## The Prebate

To offset the regressive nature of a consumption tax (poor people spend a higher percentage of income on necessities), the FairTax includes a monthly "prebate" — essentially a universal basic income payment equal to the poverty level spending times the 23% tax rate.

For a family of four in 2025, this would be approximately $700/month. This is the largest universal cash transfer program ever proposed by Republicans, though they avoid calling it that.

## Why This Bill Never Passes

Every Congress since 1999 has seen the FairTax introduced. It has never received:
- A committee markup
- A floor vote
- A CBO score

The reasons are complex:
1. **Revenue uncertainty**: No CBO score means no idea if it actually works
2. **Constitutional concerns**: May require repealing the 16th Amendment
3. **Transition chaos**: Moving from income to sales tax would be enormously disruptive
4. **Political reality**: Abolishing income tax benefits high earners; 30% sales tax hurts consumers

## The Persistence Award

H.R. 25 holds an unofficial record: introduced in 26 consecutive Congresses without ever receiving a floor vote. The bill number itself (25) is reserved by its sponsors each Congress as a reference to the tax rate. That's commitment to a bit.
