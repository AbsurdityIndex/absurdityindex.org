## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Zombie Programs Survival Guide Act would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to compile and publish a comprehensive list of all federal programs whose authorizations have expired but which continue to receive annual appropriations. The bill would also require agencies to justify continued spending on unauthorized programs.

## Bill Details

According to the Congressional Budget Office, hundreds of federal programs worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual spending operate without current authorizations. These "zombie programs" persist because Congress funds them through the appropriations process without bothering to reauthorize the underlying legislation.

The bill would have required:
- GAO to compile and maintain a public database of expired authorizations
- Agencies to explain why continued funding is necessary
- Annual updates to the "survival guide"
- Public transparency about unauthorized spending

## The Zombie Problem

The bill name is cheeky, but the problem is real. Programs can run for years or even decades past their authorization expiration dates. Examples include:
- Certain Department of Justice programs (unauthorized since 2009)
- Some State Department operations (unauthorized since 2003)
- Various transportation programs (expired authorizations)

The CBO estimated that in FY 2021, over $400 billion was appropriated for expired authorizations. That's nearly half a trillion dollars spent on programs Congress hasn't formally reauthorized.

## Why It Happens

The authorization-appropriations distinction creates this zombie army:
- **Authorization** bills create programs and set funding limits
- **Appropriations** bills actually provide the money

Authorizations typically expire after a few years, but appropriations committees can keep funding programs regardless. The result: programs shuffle along indefinitely without Congress ever formally reviewing whether they should continue.

## The Irony

Sen. Lankford has made government waste a signature issue, publishing an annual "Federal Fumbles" report highlighting questionable spending. The Zombie Programs Survival Guide Act would have institutionalized this kind of oversight.

The bill died in committee — meaning the legislation designed to expose undead programs was itself killed. The zombie programs, meanwhile, continue to receive funding.
