## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Zombie Programs Survival Guide Act would require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to compile and publish a comprehensive list of all federal programs whose authorizations have expired but which continue to receive annual appropriations. The bill would also require agencies to justify continued spending on unauthorized programs.

## Bill Details

According to the Congressional Budget Office, hundreds of federal programs worth hundreds of billions of dollars in annual spending operate without current authorizations. These "zombie programs" persist because Congress funds them through the appropriations process without bothering to reauthorize the underlying legislation.

The bill name is cheeky, but the problem is real. Programs can run for years or even decades past their authorization expiration dates. The legislation would shine a spotlight on this practice by requiring a public "survival guide" — essentially a list of all the undead programs shambling through the federal budget. Sen. Lankford has made government waste a signature issue, publishing an annual "Federal Fumbles" report.
