## What This Bill Would Have Done

The COVFEFE Act, the Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act, was introduced on June 12, 2017, just days after President Trump's viral "covfefe" tweet. The bill proposed amending the Presidential Records Act of 1978 to include social media posts as official presidential records subject to preservation requirements.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

The COVFEFE Act would amend the Presidential Records Act of 1978 to include the term "presidential social media account" as a type of documentary material covered by the Act. This would ensure that personal social media accounts used by the President for official business would be treated the same as other presidential records.

## Bill Details

While the underlying policy question of preserving presidential social media communications is a legitimate governance concern, the bill's naming was widely seen as a political troll capitalizing on a viral moment. The backronym was crafted specifically to spell "COVFEFE":

- **C**ommunications
- **O**ver
- **V**arious
- **F**eeds
- **E**lectronically for
- **F**or (wait, that's two F's)
- **E**ngagement

The bill never advanced past committee. However, the underlying question of whether presidential social media constitutes an official record requiring preservation has genuine policy merit and remains debated.

## The Context

On May 31, 2017, President Trump posted a tweet that read "Despite the constant negative press covfefe" before apparently being deleted. The incomplete tweet became a viral sensation. Eleven days later, Rep. Mike Quigley introduced this bill, demonstrating impressive speed in congressional backronym creation.
