## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) provides FY2023 appropriations for federal agencies and includes several other provisions. The omnibus packages all 12 regular appropriations bills into a single legislative vehicle, providing $1.7 trillion in discretionary spending.

The bill was assembled in its final form over a period of approximately 72 hours, with the full text released at 1:30 AM on December 20, 2022. Members of Congress had roughly 48 hours to review 4,155 pages of legislation before the first procedural votes.

## The Process

In a healthy legislative process, Congress would pass 12 individual appropriations bills through subcommittee and full committee markups, floor debate, conference committees, and final passage — all before the September 30 fiscal year deadline.

In practice, Congress missed that deadline by nearly three months. The government operated on a series of continuing resolutions while leadership negotiated behind closed doors. The final product was released in the dead of night with a "take it or leave it" ultimatum backed by the threat of a government shutdown during the holiday season.

## Notable Provisions

This omnibus included major policy changes that had nothing to do with annual spending:

- **Electoral Count Reform:** Post-January 6th reforms to presidential election certification
- **SECURE 2.0:** The most significant retirement policy changes in years
- **TikTok Government Device Ban:** Because national security
- **Over 7,500 earmarks:** Approximately $15.3 billion in member-directed spending
