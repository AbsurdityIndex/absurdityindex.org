## Congressional Research Service Summary

Senate Resolution 353 designated August 2021 as National Catfish Month. The resolution recognized the U.S. farm-raised catfish industry's contributions to the economy, particularly in Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas, which together produce the majority of the nation's catfish.

## Bill Details

The catfish industry is a genuine economic force in the American South — the United States produces over 300 million pounds of farm-raised catfish annually. Mississippi alone accounts for a significant share of national production. The resolution highlighted catfish as a healthy, domestically produced protein source.

National Catfish Month has been designated by Senate resolution multiple times across various Congresses, making it a recurring tradition. The resolution passed by unanimous consent, meaning the full Senate agreed without objection that catfish deserve their own month. In fairness, if bourbon gets one, catfish probably should too.
