## Congressional Research Service Summary

Senate Resolution 353 designated August 2021 as National Catfish Month. The resolution recognized the U.S. farm-raised catfish industry's contributions to the economy, particularly in Southern states like Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas, which together produce the majority of the nation's catfish.

## Bill Details

The catfish industry is a genuine economic force in the American South — the United States produces over 300 million pounds of farm-raised catfish annually. Mississippi alone accounts for a significant share of national production. The resolution highlighted catfish as a healthy, domestically produced protein source.

The resolution specifically noted:
- U.S. farm-raised catfish is produced in over 100,000 surface acres of ponds
- The industry supports tens of thousands of jobs
- Catfish farming began in the 1960s and has grown into a major agricultural sector
- American catfish meets strict USDA inspection standards

## A Recurring Tradition

National Catfish Month has been designated by Senate resolution multiple times across various Congresses, making it a recurring tradition. The resolution passed by unanimous consent, meaning the full Senate agreed without objection that catfish deserve their own month.

In fairness, if bourbon gets one, catfish probably should too. And unlike debates over infrastructure or voting rights, this is something the entire Senate can agree on. The catfish industry provides real jobs and produces real food — even if the congressional recognition is mostly ceremonial.

## The Catfish States

Mississippi leads the nation in catfish production, followed by:
- Alabama
- Arkansas
- Texas
- Louisiana

These states have turned catfish farming into a significant agricultural industry, with the delta regions of Mississippi and Arkansas being particularly suited to pond-raised catfish.
