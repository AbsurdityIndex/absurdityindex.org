## Section 1. Short Title and Finding of Obvious Necessity

This Act may be cited as the **"Common Sense Not Found Act of 2025"** or, for those who have already lost interest, the **"Just Say What You Mean Act."**

Congress finds and declares the following:

> (a) The average federal bill contains more subordinate clauses than a family reunion seating chart.
>
> (b) No fewer than 94% of Americans have, at some point, attempted to read legislation and immediately fallen asleep.
>
> (c) The phrase "notwithstanding any other provision of law" appears in federal statute approximately 11,000 times, and no human alive can explain what it means in context.

## Section 2. Plain English Mandate

### 2(a). Readability Requirements

All legislation introduced in either chamber of Congress shall achieve a minimum **Flesch-Kincaid readability score of 60**, equivalent to language comprehensible by an eighth-grader who has not yet had their spirit crushed by standardized testing.

### 2(b). Prohibited Phrases

The following phrases are hereby banned from all legislative text, effective immediately:

- "Notwithstanding any other provision of law"
- "For the purposes of this subsection, as defined in subsection (c)(2)(iv)(A)(iii)"
- "Shall be construed to mean" followed by something that means the opposite
- Any sentence exceeding 150 words (looking at you, Appropriations)
- The word "synergy" in any context whatsoever

## Section 3. The Clarity Score System

### 3(a). Establishment of the Federal Clarity Bureau

There is hereby established within the Library of Congress a **Federal Clarity Bureau (FCB)**, staffed by English teachers, frustrated copy editors, and at least one person who has successfully assembled IKEA furniture using only the instructions provided.

### 3(b). Scoring Methodology

Each bill introduced in Congress shall receive a **Clarity Score** from 1 to 10, where:

- **10** = "A child could understand this"
- **7** = "Readable with coffee"
- **5** = "Requires a law degree and mild desperation"
- **3** = "Technically in English"
- **1** = "Has anyone actually read this? Anyone at all?"

Bills scoring below a 5 shall be returned to their sponsors with a red pen and a note that says "See me after class."

## Section 4. Penalties for Excessive Jargon

### 4(a). First Offense

Any legislator who introduces a bill with a Clarity Score below 3 shall be required to read the entire bill aloud on live congressional television during prime time, without bathroom breaks.

### 4(b). Second Offense

Repeat offenders shall be enrolled in a mandatory **"Writing for Humans"** workshop at the nearest community college, at their own expense.

### 4(c). Third Offense

Upon a third violation, the offending legislator's staff shall be authorized to replace all future bill drafts with a simple bulleted list of what the bill actually does, which, frankly, is what should have been happening all along.

## Section 5. Effective Date and Irony Acknowledgment

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment, which Congress acknowledges is itself written in a somewhat convoluted manner, thereby proving the necessity of the Act itself.

> **Committee Note:** This bill was approved 34-1 in committee. The lone dissenting vote came from a member who objected that the bill "lacked sufficient wherewiths and hereinafters." His objection was noted, then ignored.

---

*Amendment 1 (adopted): Added requirement that all bills include a "TL;DR" summary of no more than 280 characters. Passed 402-28, with 28 members voting against because they did not know what "TL;DR" means.*
