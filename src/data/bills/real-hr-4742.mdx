## What This Bill Would Have Done

The STABLE GENIUS Act, the Standardizing Testing and Accountability Before Large Elections Giving Electors Necessary Information for Unobstructed Selection Act, was introduced in January 2018. It proposed requiring all presidential and vice-presidential candidates to undergo comprehensive medical examinations, including mental health evaluations, and publicly release the results.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

The STABLE GENIUS Act would require candidates for President and Vice President to undergo medical examinations by the Physician to the President (or equivalent) and publicly release the results. The examinations would include cognitive assessments and mental health evaluations.

## Bill Details

The bill was introduced shortly after President Trump described himself as a "very stable genius" on Twitter. The legislation would have required candidates to be examined by the physician to the President (or equivalent) and mandated public disclosure of the results, including any cognitive assessments.

The tortured backronym, squeezing "STABLE GENIUS" out of:
- **S**table
- **T**able (wait, no...)
- **A**ble...

Actually, let's look at the full title: "Stable Genius Inquiries and Notification of Evaluations to Uncover Spoonfed Diagnoses"

The actual policy proposal of requiring medical transparency from presidential candidates has been debated for decades. However, the naming made it clear this was as much political commentary as serious legislation. It never received a hearing.

## The Context

On January 6, 2018, President Trump tweeted that he was "a very stable genius." Three days later, Rep. Brendan Boyle introduced this bill. While the underlying policy question of presidential fitness has genuine merit, the timing and naming demonstrated that the bill was primarily designed to generate media coverage.
