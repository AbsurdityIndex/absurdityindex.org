## Congressional Research Service Summary

The STABLE GENIUS Act — Stable Genius Inquiries and Notification of Evaluations to Uncover Spoonfed Diagnoses Act — was introduced in January 2018. It proposed requiring all presidential and vice-presidential candidates to undergo comprehensive medical examinations, including mental health evaluations, and publicly release the results.

## Bill Details

The bill was introduced shortly after President Trump described himself as a "very stable genius" on Twitter. The legislation would have required candidates to be examined by the physician to the President (or equivalent) and mandated public disclosure of the results, including any cognitive assessments.

The actual policy proposal of requiring medical transparency from presidential candidates has been debated for decades. However, the tortured backronym — squeezing "STABLE GENIUS" out of a string of words — made it clear this was as much political commentary as serious legislation. It never received a hearing.
