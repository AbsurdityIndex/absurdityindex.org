summary: "Congress funds 5 of 12 departments while leaving DHS to coast on 2025 money. It's budgeting via checkout aisle impulse buys."
theGist: "Congress just passed a $2+ trillion omnibus spending bill that funds five of twelve regular budget items—meaning seven departments are still operating on fumes through a continuing resolution. It's like paying your electric bill but forgetting about water, gas, and that thing called the Department of Homeland Security, which now runs on a short leash until mid-February. The absurdity isn't what's in the bill; it's what's conspicuously missing from it."
whyItMatters: "Millions of federal employees, benefit recipients, and anyone who depends on TSA screening or federal transportation infrastructure are living under budget uncertainty while Congress sorts out the remaining seven appropriations bills. Agencies funded through continuing resolutions can't start new initiatives, hire staff, or plan beyond their CR expiration date—which, for DHS, is approximately 11 days away."
crsSummary: "Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026This bill provides appropriations to several federal departments and agencies for the remainder of FY2026 and provides continuing FY2026 appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through February 13, 2026. It also extends various expiring programs and authorities.Specifically, the bill includes 5 of the 12 regular FY2026 appropriations bills:the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2026;the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations&nbsp;Act, 2026;&nbsp;the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026;the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2026; andthe National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026.The departments, agencies, and activities funded in the bill includethe&nbsp;Department of Defense,the Department of Labor,the Department of Health and Human Services,the Department of Education,the Department of Transportation,the Department of Housing and Urban Development,&nbsp;the Department of the Treasury,the Executive Office of the President,the judiciary,the District of Columbia,the Department of State and related programs,the administration and oversight of foreign assistance programs, &nbsp;bilateral economic assistance,international security assistance,multilateral assistance,export and investment assistance, andseveral related and independent agencies.In addition, the bill includes a continuing resolution (CR) that provides continuing FY2026 appropriations to DHS through the earlier of February 13, 2026, or the enactment of the DHS appropriations act. The CR funds most DHS programs and activities at the FY2025 levels.The bill also extends several expiring programs and authorities, includingthe U.S. Grain Standards Act;the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s whistleblower program;the National Flood Insurance Program;the Forest Ser"

## What's Actually In It

This is what happens when Congress decides to cram five of twelve annual spending bills into one legislative vehicle and hope nobody notices: a $1.2 trillion omnibus that funds everything from aircraft carriers to the National Flood Insurance Program. The bill covers the Department of Defense, Labor, HHS, Education, Transportation, HUD, Treasury, the Judiciary, and State Department, plus a bunch of independent agencies that probably could've waited until next week. It also includes a temporary patch for the Department of Homeland Security that lasts until mid-February, because apparently we enjoy budgetary cliffhangers.

## The Fine Print

Buried in here are extensions for seventeen different expiring programs that most Americans have never heard of, including the CFTC's whistleblower program, the Motor Carrier Safety Advisory Committee, and—inexplicably—the U.S. Grain Standards Act. The bill also revives the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program and extends various cybersecurity authorities, trade preferences for Haiti, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission's jurisdiction over guidelines related to unmanned aircraft. You know, just normal government stuff.

## The Process

The House passed this by exactly three votes (217-214) on February 3rd and the President signed it the same day. That razor-thin margin suggests this bill was about as popular as a gluten-free pizza party, but it passed anyway, which is how omnibus bills work: everyone holds their nose, votes for it, and then complains to their constituents about the provisions they didn't like.
