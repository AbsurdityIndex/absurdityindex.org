## Congressional Research Service Summary

The Abolish the ATF Act would eliminate the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as a federal agency. Its law enforcement functions would be transferred to the FBI, and its regulatory functions related to firearms and explosives would be wound down.

## Bill Details

The ATF has been a lightning rod for controversy since the Waco siege in 1993. This bill represents the most direct legislative response: simply dissolving the agency. Any ongoing criminal investigations would transfer to the FBI, and employees could apply for positions at the receiving agency.

The bill attracted 22 cosponsors, all Republicans, reflecting a significant caucus of lawmakers who view the ATF's regulatory activities — particularly regarding firearms — as federal overreach. Critics of the bill argue that the ATF's specialized expertise in firearms trafficking, arson investigation, and explosives regulation would be diluted or lost within the larger FBI bureaucracy. The bill did not advance past committee.
