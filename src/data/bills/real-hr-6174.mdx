## What This Bill Actually Does

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act prohibits the distribution, maintenance, or updating of applications controlled by foreign adversaries — specifically targeting TikTok — unless the application severs ties with entities controlled by foreign adversaries. ByteDance was given a deadline to divest its ownership of TikTok or face removal from U.S. app stores.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill prohibits distributing, maintaining, or updating foreign adversary controlled applications by entities within U.S. jurisdiction. It specifically targets applications operated by ByteDance Ltd. or its subsidiaries, including TikTok. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations and provides a divestiture pathway.

## Bill Details

The bill passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support (352-65) and was signed into law as part of a foreign aid package. The implementation has been subject to ongoing legal challenges and executive action delays.

## Note: Duplicate Bill Numbers

This bill (H.R. 6174) and H.R. 7521 are related versions of the same legislation. H.R. 7521 was the version that was ultimately signed into law after being packaged with foreign aid. Both bills targeted TikTok and ByteDance.
