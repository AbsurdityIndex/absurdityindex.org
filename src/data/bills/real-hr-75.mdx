## Congressional Research Service Summary

The American Sovereignty Restoration Act proposed a complete withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations. It would repeal the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, end all U.S. financial contributions to the UN, and require the removal of the United Nations headquarters from U.S. territory.

## Bill Details

Versions of this bill have been introduced repeatedly since the late 1990s, originally championed by Rep. Ron Paul. The legislation would terminate U.S. involvement in all UN bodies including the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and the International Court of Justice. It would also end diplomatic immunity for UN officials in the United States.

The bill reflects a strain of American political thought that views the UN as an infringement on national sovereignty. Proponents argue the U.S. gives more than it gets. Critics counter that withdrawing from the world's primary multilateral institution would be diplomatically catastrophic. The bill has never advanced past committee in any Congress.
