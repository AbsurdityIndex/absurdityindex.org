## Congressional Research Service Summary

H.R. 469 authorizes the Architect of the Capitol to produce and install the "Semiquincentennial Congressional Time Capsule" on the west lawn of the United States Capitol on or before July 4, 2026. The capsule is to remain sealed until July 4, 2276 — the 500th anniversary of the founding of the United States. Contents are to be determined by the offices of congressional leadership and will include items representing important legislation, institutional milestones, and a message from the current Congress to the future Congress.

## Bill Details

Congress is burying a box in the ground and asking people in the year 2276 to dig it up.

Let that sink in. The 119th Congress — the one that couldn't keep the government funded for more than two weeks at a stretch — found bipartisan consensus on a project with a 250-year timeline. Fifty-four members cosponsored this bill. The actual appropriations bill that funds the government passed 217-214.

Here's what we know about the capsule:

- **Location:** West lawn of the U.S. Capitol
- **Buried by:** July 4, 2026
- **Opened:** July 4, 2276
- **Contents selected by:** The Speaker, House Minority Leader, and Senate Majority and Minority Leaders
- **Contents include:** Books, manuscripts, legislative milestones, and "a message from the current Congress"

The message from the current Congress to the year 2276 is the real punchline. What do you say to a Congress 250 years in the future? "Sorry about the debt"? "We tried"? "The filibuster is still a thing, isn't it"?

## The Vote

Passed by voice vote on February 26, 2025. A voice vote means no individual member is on record voting for or against burying a box in the ground. This is either procedural efficiency or strategic deniability. Both are very congressional.

## The Timeline Problem

The most absurd part isn't the capsule itself — it's the context. This bill passed while Congress was engaged in an ongoing funding crisis that would culminate in the January 2026 government shutdown. The pattern:

- **Can't agree on:** Funding DHS for more than 14 days
- **Can agree on:** A 250-year plan to bury keepsakes on the lawn
- **Margin for government funding:** 217-214 (3 votes)
- **Margin for time capsule:** Voice vote (unanimous-ish)

The capsule is scheduled to be opened on America's 500th birthday. For perspective, 250 years ago from today was 1776. Nobody in 1776 was making plans for 2026. Because they were busy with a revolution, not commemorating one.

## What Should Go in the Capsule

The bill leaves the contents up to congressional leadership, but some suggestions:

- A continuing resolution, so future Americans can see what Congress spent most of its time on
- A copy of the debt clock, frozen at whatever terrifying number it hits in 2026
- The Congressional Record from a day when both chambers were technically in session but fewer than 20 members were present
- A $2.50 commemorative coin (see: H.R. 5616), so future Americans can wonder what that was about too

## Why It's a 7 on the Absurdity Index

A time capsule is harmless, even charming. But scoring a 7 isn't about the capsule — it's about the contrast. This is a Congress that cannot perform its most fundamental duty (passing a budget) but achieves bipartisan consensus on a project no living person will see completed. It passed by voice vote while actual governance required arm-twisting and government shutdowns. The absurdity isn't what they're doing. It's what they're not doing instead.
