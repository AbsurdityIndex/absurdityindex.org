summary: "Two appropriations bills walk into a bar, Congress says \"close enough,\" passes it with barely any debate."
theGist: "Congress just passed a mega-bill funding literally everything from the Treasury Department to the State Department to the Judiciary—basically the entire machinery of U.S. government minus agriculture and defense—by cramming two of twelve appropriations bills into one legislative Frankenstein. It passed 341-79, which is congressional-speak for \"nobody wanted to read this thing, so we all just agreed it probably funds important stuff and moved on.\""
whyItMatters: "This bill controls funding for everything from embassy operations to Treasury enforcement to the federal courts—so whether the IRS can audit anyone, whether the State Department can actually do diplomacy, and whether judges get paid depends on this passing. But the real impact is less about what's *in* it and more about what Congress is *not doing*: properly debating and voting on twelve separate spending bills like it's supposed to, instead just bundling the unpopular stuff together and hoping you don't notice."
crsSummary: "Financial Services and General Government and National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026This bill provides FY2026 appropriations to several federal departments and agencies for activities and programs related to financial services, general government, national security, the administration of foreign affairs, and foreign assistance.&nbsp;Specifically, the bill includes 2 of the 12 regular FY2026 appropriations bills: (1) the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2026; and (2) the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2026.The departments, agencies, and activities funded in the bill includethe Department of the Treasury,the Executive Office of the President,the judiciary,the District of Columbia,&nbsp;the Department of State and related programs,the administration and oversight of foreign assistance programs,&nbsp;&nbsp;bilateral economic assistance,international security assistance,multilateral assistance,&nbsp;export and investment assistance, andseveral related and independent agencies.The bill also sets forth requirements and restrictions for using funds provided by this and other appropriations acts."

## The Process

H.R. 7006 had the legislative equivalent of a speed run. It moved through the House on January 14th like a appropriations bill possessed, bouncing from Committee of the Whole to passage (341–79) in what appears to have been a single day of consideration. The Senate received it on January 15th, which is the legislative equivalent of catching a football someone just threw at your face. As of now, it's sitting in the Senate waiting to see if anyone actually reads the thing before voting.

## What's Actually In It

This bill is essentially a legislative kitchen sink—it's actually *two* separate appropriations bills crammed together because apparently efficiency means "just combine them." We're talking about funding for:

- The Treasury Department, the President's office, and the judiciary (the money people, the decision people, and the referee people)
- The State Department and all its foreign affairs operations
- International assistance programs, from bilateral aid to multilateral organizations
- Export and investment assistance (helping American businesses go global)
- Various independent agencies that do things Congress would rather not explain individually

The bill also sets spending rules and restrictions for how agencies can actually use their money—basically the legislative equivalent of handing someone a check and a 47-page instruction manual.

## The Fine Print

Buried in here are "requirements and restrictions" on fund usage across multiple appropriations acts. Translation: there are almost certainly carve-outs, earmarks, and conditions that benefit specific districts or programs, but the CRS summary isn't telling us what they are. You'd need to actually read the full text to find out what your representative slipped in for their donors.
