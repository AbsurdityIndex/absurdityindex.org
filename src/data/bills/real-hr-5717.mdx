## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill proposed increased transparency and accountability in the National Science Foundation's grant-making process. It was introduced amid congressional scrutiny of specific NSF-funded research projects, most notably a $384,949 grant to Yale University to study the evolution of duck reproductive organs.

## Bill Details

The grant funded research by evolutionary biologist Patricia Brennan on the co-evolution of male and female reproductive anatomy in waterfowl. The research examined how an evolutionary "arms race" between the sexes shaped the unusual morphology of duck reproductive organs. The study was published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and contributed to understanding of sexual selection and evolutionary biology.

However, when the grant appeared in congressional "waste" reports, the headlines wrote themselves. Rep. Jeff Flake included it in his "Wastebook" highlights, and the study became a recurring example in debates over federal research spending priorities. Dr. Brennan wrote a public defense of her work, arguing that basic science research often appears frivolous to non-scientists but can yield important insights. The episode highlighted the tension between political accountability for public spending and the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry.

> **Source:** This bill was introduced in the 112th Congress. The duck research was funded by NSF grant IOS-0920344. [View on Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5717).
