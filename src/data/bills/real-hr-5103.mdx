## Congressional Research Service Summary

The One Subject at a Time Act would require that each bill or joint resolution introduced in Congress embrace no more than one subject, which must be clearly expressed in the bill's title. Any provision found to violate this rule could be challenged and struck down by any federal court.

## Bill Details

This bill attacks one of the most widely criticized practices in Congress: the omnibus bill. Massive spending bills routinely combine hundreds of unrelated provisions, forcing lawmakers into all-or-nothing votes. The result is that deeply controversial measures can hitch a ride on must-pass legislation without ever receiving an up-or-down vote on their own merits.

Many state legislatures already have single-subject rules in their constitutions. The federal government does not. Versions of the One Subject at a Time Act have been introduced in multiple Congresses by members of both parties, yet it has never advanced. The irony is hard to miss: the one reform that might actually improve the legislative process can't get through the legislative process.
