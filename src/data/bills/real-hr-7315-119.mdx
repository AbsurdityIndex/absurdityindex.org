summary: "Mystery bill gets referred to every House committee at once; actual contents remain classified as \"TBD by the Speaker.\""
theGist: "Congress just introduced a bill so ambitious—or so confused—that it got referred to literally every committee in the House. We're talking 24 committees, each getting their own copy on the same day, with zero actual bill text available. It's the legislative equivalent of hitting \"reply all\" on an office email and hoping someone figures out what you meant."
whyItMatters: "Without seeing the actual bill language, we can't tell if this is genuine omnibus legislation or an administrative error that escaped into the wild. Either way, it's a preview of how Congress processes major bills—by committee shotgunning them to every relevant (and irrelevant) office and hoping the committees sort it out later. The real impact depends entirely on what's hidden in those unposted pages."

## The Process

H.R. 7315 was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means on February 2, 2026—and also simultaneously referred to approximately 17 other committees, which is legislative code for "we have no idea what's actually in this thing." The bill then received six identical referral actions on the same day, suggesting either a clerical error of epic proportions or the legislative equivalent of hitting "Reply All" by accident. As of now, it remains in committee limbo, waiting for the Speaker to determine how long each committee gets to consider it, which is itself a decision that apparently hasn't been made.

## The Fine Print

Without a CRS summary available, the actual contents of this 9/10 absurdity-scored omnibus bill remain a mystery wrapped in a referral riddled with redundancy. What we *can* say: any bill that gets routed to 17+ committees covering everything from Veterans' Affairs to the Intelligence Committee to the Ethics Committee is almost certainly doing something. Whether that something is reforming agricultural subsidies, restructuring the Pentagon, or declaring a national waffle day remains locked away in the legislative Schrödinger's box known as "Committee Staff Review."
