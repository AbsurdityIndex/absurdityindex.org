summary: "Sprawling omnibus bill covering agriculture, veterans, federal retirement, and retirement savings gets referred to 21 House committees at once."
theGist: "Congress just introduced a bill so ambitious—or so confused—that it got referred to 21 committees in the House on the same day. The bill itself is a legislative grab bag spanning agriculture, veterans' apprenticeships, federal employee disability retirement, and a sweeping overhaul of retirement savings rules. It's the legislative equivalent of cramming four separate bills into a trench coat and hoping no one notices."
whyItMatters: "This bill touches everything from automatic 401(k) enrollment and student loan matching to veterans' apprenticeship programs and livestock reporting deadlines. The sheer breadth explains the 21-committee referral—every committee gets a slice because the bill spans their jurisdictions. It's a preview of how Congress processes omnibus legislation: shotgun it to every office and hope the committees sort it out later. Whether any of these provisions survive the committee gauntlet is another question entirely."

## The Process

H.R. 7315 was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means on February 2, 2026—and also simultaneously referred to 20 other committees (21 total), which is what happens when a single bill tries to reform agriculture, veterans' programs, federal retirement, and private retirement savings all at once. Each committee gets jurisdiction over the provisions that fall within its domain. As of now, it remains in committee limbo, waiting for the Speaker to determine how long each committee gets to consider it, which is itself a decision that apparently hasn't been made.

## The Fine Print

The bill text *is* publicly available, and it's a doozy. Title I extends livestock mandatory reporting. Title II requires the DoD and Department of Labor to help veterans find apprenticeships. Title III overhauls disability retirement for federal employees injured in the line of duty. Title IV is the heavyweight: a sweeping set of retirement savings reforms including automatic 401(k) enrollment, enhanced small-employer tax credits, student loan payment matching, expanded catch-up contributions for ages 62–64, and new rules for part-time workers, military spouses, and pooled employer plans. No CRS summary exists yet, which—given the bill spans 20+ committees' jurisdictions—is either a staffing problem or a quiet admission that summarizing this thing is its own full-time job.
