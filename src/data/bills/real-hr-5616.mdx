## Congressional Research Service Summary

H.R. 5616 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in several denominations to commemorate the semiquincentennial (250th anniversary) of the founding of the United States. The bill establishes a $25 gold coin, a $2.50 silver coin (up to 500,000 units), a proof 5-ounce silver $2.50 coin (up to 100,000 units), and a 25-cent clad coin. Surcharges from sales are directed to the America 250 Foundation for the restoration and rehabilitation of National Park System units.

## Bill Details

In a stroke of legislative creativity, Congress has proposed bringing back the $2.50 coin — a denomination last struck for circulation in 1929, the year the stock market crashed. The "quarter eagle," as numismatists call it, went the way of the dodo, the rotary phone, and bipartisan compromise.

The coins would feature designs based on the 1926 sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) commemorative, because when you can't agree on anything new, you can always recycle something from a century ago.

Here's what taxpayers would get:

- **$25 gold coins** — For collectors who think regular gold coins aren't exclusive enough
- **$2.50 silver coins** (1.5 inches, 90% silver) — The main attraction, limited to 500,000
- **5-ounce proof silver $2.50 coins** (3 inches) — For people who want a coin the size of a coaster
- **25-cent clad coins** — Because even commemorative programs need a participation trophy

Each coin carries a surcharge ($10-$50 depending on type) that goes to the America 250 Foundation for National Park restoration. At least the money goes somewhere nice.

## The Timing

This bill was introduced on September 30, 2025. By January 2026, Congress couldn't pass a budget to keep the government open for more than two weeks at a time. But commemorative coins? Those apparently require no such urgency. The bill has been sitting in committee since October, unbothered by the chaos around it.

The minting window is January 1 through December 31, 2026 — meaning Congress needs to actually pass this bill for the coins to exist. Given the current pace, the 300th anniversary coins might be more realistic.

## Why It's a 5 on the Absurdity Index

On one hand, commemorative coins are a long tradition, they're self-funding through surcharges, and the proceeds go to National Parks. On the other hand, Congress is literally minting money it can't manage to budget. The $2.50 denomination is a choice — it's like bringing back the farthing to celebrate the Magna Carta. The bill is harmless but delightfully tone-deaf when juxtaposed with Congress's inability to perform its most basic function: keeping the lights on.
