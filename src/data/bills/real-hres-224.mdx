## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 224 supported the designation of March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day. The resolution recognized the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159) and encouraged schools and educators to observe the day with activities that teach students about pi and engage them in the study of mathematics.

## Bill Details

The resolution passed the House on March 12, 2009 — just in time for Pi Day on March 14 (3/14). It cited the importance of mathematics and science education and noted that pi has been studied for over 4,000 years.

The resolution specifically noted:
- Pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter
- The Greek letter for pi was first used in 1706 by mathematician William Jones
- Pi has been calculated to over 1 trillion digits beyond its decimal point
- Pi is an irrational number — it cannot be expressed as a fraction and its digits never end or repeat

## The Vote

The resolution passed 391-10, with 32 members not voting. The ten "no" votes remain a mystery — perhaps they preferred tau (2*pi), or maybe they just don't like circles.

## Why It Matters (Sort Of)

Of all the commemorative resolutions Congress passes, this one is among the most endearing. It's hard to argue against encouraging kids to learn math. The resolution is non-binding, costs nothing, and gives math teachers a fun excuse to bring pie (the edible kind) to class.

March 14 also happens to be Albert Einstein's birthday, making it a doubly significant day for science nerds. Some schools celebrate both by eating circular desserts while discussing relativity.

If Congress must spend time on commemorative resolutions, this is about as harmless as it gets.
