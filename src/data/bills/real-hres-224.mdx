## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 224 supported the designation of March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day. The resolution recognized the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159) and encouraged schools and educators to observe the day with activities that teach students about pi and engage them in the study of mathematics.

## Bill Details

The resolution passed the House on March 12, 2009 — just in time for Pi Day on March 14 (3/14). It cited the importance of mathematics and science education and noted that pi has been studied for over 4,000 years.

Of all the commemorative resolutions Congress passes, this one is among the most endearing. It's hard to argue against encouraging kids to learn math. The resolution is non-binding, costs nothing, and gives math teachers a fun excuse to bring pie (the edible kind) to class. If Congress must spend time on commemorative resolutions, this is about as harmless as it gets.
