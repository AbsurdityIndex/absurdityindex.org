## Congressional Research Service Summary

The rules package for the 119th Congress (H.Res. 5) included provisions formally distinguishing between "calendar days" and "legislative days." Under congressional procedure, a "legislative day" begins when the chamber convenes and ends when it adjourns — meaning a single legislative day can stretch across multiple calendar days if the chamber recesses rather than adjourns.

## Bill Details

This procedural quirk has been part of congressional operations for over a century, but its formal codification in the 119th Congress rules package drew renewed attention. The Senate has famously exploited the "legislative day" concept — in 1980, a single Senate "legislative day" lasted from January 3 to June 12, spanning 162 calendar days.

The practical effect is that deadlines written in "legislative days" can be stretched far beyond what a normal person would consider reasonable. A requirement to act within "10 days" might mean 10 actual days — or 10 months, depending on the chamber's recess schedule. Critics call it a loophole that allows Congress to dodge its own deadlines. Defenders call it a necessary procedural flexibility. Everyone else calls it absurd.
