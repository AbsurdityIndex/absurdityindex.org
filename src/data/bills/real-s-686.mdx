## What This Bill Actually Does

The RESTRICT Act would grant the Secretary of Commerce broad authority to review and potentially ban technology transactions with foreign adversaries that pose national security risks. Unlike the narrower TikTok ban that eventually passed, this bill would have covered information and communications technology products and services from any designated foreign adversary. (Note: The RESTRICT Act is sometimes confused with the separately-introduced ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, H.R. 1081, which targeted similar issues with a more memorable acronym.)

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to review and prohibit certain transactions between U.S. persons and foreign adversaries that pose an undue or unacceptable risk to national security. It covers information and communications technology products and services from designated foreign adversaries including China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, and Venezuela.

## The Backronym Hall of Fame

While S. 686 is the RESTRICT Act, a separate House bill (H.R. 1081) targeting similar issues was named the "Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act" — reverse-engineered to spell ANTI-SOCIAL CCP. Congressional staffers deserve either a medal or a stern talking-to for that one.

Other notable congressional backronyms:
- **USA PATRIOT Act**: Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism
- **COVFEFE Act**: Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically for Engagement Act
- **STABLE GENIUS Act**: Standardizing Testing and Accountability Before Large Elections Giving Electors Necessary Information for Unobstructed Selection Act

## Why This Bill Failed (And Why TikTok Ban Passed)

The RESTRICT Act was a comprehensive framework that would have given the Commerce Department broad authority over foreign tech. Critics raised legitimate concerns:

1. **VPN Criminalization**: The bill's criminal penalties could have applied to users circumventing bans via VPNs
2. **Executive Overreach**: Broad authority with minimal congressional oversight
3. **Vague Definitions**: "Undue risk" left too much interpretation to regulators

The narrower TikTok-specific approach (H.R. 7521) succeeded because it targeted one company with specific divestiture requirements, avoiding the broader constitutional and policy concerns.
