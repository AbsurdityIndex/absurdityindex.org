## What This Bill Did

The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 combined appropriations for Agriculture, Transportation-HUD, and Commerce-Justice-Science into a single "minibus" package. This approach allowed Congress to pass multiple spending bills that couldn't pass individually by bundling them together.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 - Makes appropriations for FY2012 for the Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, and related agencies.

## Bill Details

The bill became famous for containing the provision that blocked USDA nutrition standards for school lunches (the "pizza is a vegetable" language), but it contained much more:

- **Division A**: Agriculture, Rural Development, FDA appropriations
- **Division B**: Commerce, Justice, Science appropriations
- **Division C**: Transportation, HUD appropriations
- **Division D**: Continuing appropriations for other agencies

With 243 amendments considered in the Senate alone, the bill became a vehicle for everything from salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest to space telescope funding in Maryland.
