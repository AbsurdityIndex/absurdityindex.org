## Section 1. Short Title and Declaration of National Pothole Emergency

This Act may be cited as the **"National Pothole Emergency Declaration Act"** or the **"My Suspension Can't Take It Anymore Act of 2025."**

Congress finds and reluctantly admits:

> (a) There are currently an estimated 33 million potholes on American roads, which is more potholes than there are residents of Texas, and substantially less charming.
>
> (b) American drivers spend an average of $600 per year on pothole-related vehicle repairs, which is coincidentally the same amount Congress spends annually on each treadmill in the Congressional gym that nobody uses.
>
> (c) Several potholes in the greater Detroit metropolitan area have been continuously present for so long that they now qualify for their own zip codes.
>
> (d) The nation has put a man on the moon, mapped the human genome, and built a global internet, but cannot seem to fill a hole in the ground.

## Section 2. Declaration of National Emergency

### 2(a). Emergency Declaration

The President is hereby authorized and strongly encouraged to declare potholes a **National Emergency**, placing them in the same threat category as hurricanes, pandemics, and that one bridge in Pittsburgh everyone is afraid of.

### 2(b). Emergency Powers

Under this declaration, the Federal Highway Administration shall have the authority to:

1. Commandeer any available asphalt within a 50-mile radius of a reported pothole
2. Deploy the Army Corps of Engineers to particularly egregious craters
3. Name and track potholes the way we name hurricanes (e.g., "Pothole Kevin," "Pothole Brenda")

## Section 3. The Federal Pothole Census

### 3(a). Comprehensive Survey

The Department of Transportation shall conduct a **nationwide pothole census** within 12 months of enactment, documenting:

- Location (GPS coordinates)
- Diameter and depth (in both inches and "number of sedans that could fit inside")
- Estimated age (carbon dating, if necessary)
- Number of citizen complaints filed (minimum three per pothole, based on historical data)
- Whether the pothole has been "temporarily" patched more than five times

### 3(b). Pothole Classification System

Potholes shall be classified according to the following scale:

- **Category 1**: Cosmetic nuisance; causes mild irritation and spilled coffee
- **Category 2**: Structural threat; has bent at least one rim this fiscal quarter
- **Category 3**: Vehicular hazard; visible from Google Earth
- **Category 4**: Geological event; has its own weather system
- **Category 5**: Has been awarded a historical preservation marker by the local community

## Section 4. Appointment of the National Pothole Czar

### 4(a). Position Established

There is hereby created the position of **National Pothole Czar**, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall serve as the nation's chief pothole strategist.

### 4(b). Qualifications

The Pothole Czar shall:

- Have at least 10 years of experience in either road maintenance or extreme frustration
- Own a vehicle with at least one pothole-related repair on record
- Be willing to drive Interstate 94 through Michigan in March as part of the interview process

### 4(c). Duties

The Pothole Czar shall coordinate all federal pothole response efforts, maintain the National Pothole Registry, and issue a quarterly "State of the Potholes" address, which Congress acknowledges nobody will watch but which will be a matter of public record nonetheless.

## Section 5. Reallocation of the Congressional Gym Budget

### 5(a). Funding Source

The annual budget for the Congressional gymnasium, fitness center, and associated amenities (estimated at $4.2 million per year, a figure that should upset everyone) is hereby **redirected in its entirety** to the National Pothole Emergency Fund.

### 5(b). Justification

Congress finds that:

> Members of Congress who wish to exercise may do so by filling potholes, which provides both cardiovascular and upper-body benefits and is substantially more useful to the American public than the current arrangement.

### 5(c). Exception

The Congressional swimming pool shall be exempt from this reallocation, as it has already been repurposed as a Category 4 pothole demonstration model.

*This bill was introduced on a Monday and by Tuesday had received more constituent letters of support than any legislation in the previous fiscal year, including the one about naming a post office. The Ad Hoc Committee on Making More Committees has referred it to a newly created Subcommittee on Potholes, which has not yet met because the chairperson got a flat tire on the way to the Capitol.*
