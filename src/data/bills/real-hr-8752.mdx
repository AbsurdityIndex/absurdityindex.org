## What This Bill Actually Does

The Methamphetamine Response Through Investigating Drug Sources Act directs federal agencies to investigate methamphetamine supply chains and identify source countries to combat the drug epidemic through better intelligence gathering and interagency coordination.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill directs the Drug Enforcement Administration and Office of National Drug Control Policy to investigate methamphetamine supply chains, identify source countries, and coordinate interagency efforts to combat methamphetamine trafficking. It requires regular reporting to Congress on findings and enforcement actions.

## Editorial Note: The Fish Connection

The "fish on meth" association comes from a separate body of federally funded research — notably a 2021 study published in the *Journal of Experimental Biology* where Czech researchers (partially funded by U.S. grants) found that fish exposed to methamphetamine-contaminated water exhibited addictive behaviors and experienced withdrawal symptoms.

While this bill itself focuses on drug sourcing rather than aquatic ecology, it sits in a broader landscape of methamphetamine-related federal spending that includes such research. The study was legitimate science: methamphetamine enters waterways through sewage and affects wildlife. Whether federal dollars should fund such research is a separate debate.

## The Meth Epidemic by the Numbers

- **Overdose deaths**: Approximately 35,000 Americans died from meth-related overdoses in 2023
- **Seizures**: DEA seized over 190,000 pounds of meth in FY2023
- **Source countries**: Primarily Mexico, with precursor chemicals from China
- **Purity**: Street meth purity has increased to over 95% while prices have dropped

The epidemic has shifted from domestic "shake and bake" labs to industrial-scale production in Mexico using Chinese-sourced precursor chemicals. This bill attempts to address that supply chain reality.
