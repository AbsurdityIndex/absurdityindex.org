## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill addresses the methamphetamine epidemic by directing resources toward investigating drug sources and supply chains. It focuses on law enforcement and research tools to combat methamphetamine trafficking.

## Editorial Note

The "fish on meth" association comes from a separate body of federally funded research — notably a 2021 study published in the *Journal of Experimental Biology* where Czech researchers found that fish exposed to methamphetamine-contaminated water exhibited addictive behaviors. While this bill itself focuses on drug sourcing rather than aquatic ecology, it sits in a broader landscape of methamphetamine-related federal spending that includes such research.
