## Congressional Research Service Summary

This legislation requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to issue detainers for undocumented immigrants who have been charged with or convicted of theft, burglary, larceny, or shoplifting. It was designated as S. 5, among the Senate's first legislative priorities.

## Bill Details

The bill was named after Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student at Augusta University who was killed while jogging in February 2024. The individual charged in her death was an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela who had previous criminal charges.

Key provisions:
- Requires ICE to issue detainers for immigrants charged with theft-related offenses
- Mandates custody within 48 hours of detainer issuance
- Allows state attorneys general to sue DHS for non-compliance
- Expands categories of crimes triggering mandatory detention

## The Vote

The bill passed both chambers with bipartisan support:
- **Senate:** 64-35 (12 Democrats voted yes)
- **House:** 263-156 (46 Democrats voted yes)

Notable Democratic crossover votes included Sens. John Fetterman (PA), Ruben Gallego (AZ), and Gary Peters (MI), all of whom face competitive elections or represent swing states.

## The Politics

The bill's swift passage — 26 days from introduction to signature — demonstrated that Congress can move quickly when there's political will. Immigration has become a potent electoral issue, and moderate Democrats in swing states and districts faced pressure to support the bill.

The "S. 5" designation placed it among the Senate majority's first priorities, signaling that immigration enforcement would be a key focus of the 119th Congress.

## Implementation Questions

The Congressional Budget Office did not fully score the bill's costs, which include:
- Expanded detention facility capacity
- Additional ICE personnel
- Legal costs from potential state lawsuits

Critics argue the bill could lead to detention of individuals based on charges alone (not convictions), while supporters contend it addresses legitimate public safety concerns.
