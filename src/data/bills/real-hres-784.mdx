## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 784 would have recognized the 2,560th birthday of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551-479 BC). The resolution cited Confucius's contributions to philosophy, education, and social thought, and noted the global influence of Confucian values including respect for elders, the importance of education, and ethical governance.

## Bill Details

The resolution attracted 41 cosponsors — a remarkable show of support for honoring a philosopher born over two and a half millennia ago. It was introduced during the same week as Confucius's birthday (September 28, 551 BC, by traditional accounts).

While Confucius's contributions to human thought are beyond dispute, one might wonder whether the U.S. House of Representatives is the most efficient mechanism for conveying belated birthday greetings — 2,560 years belated, to be precise. The resolution did not advance out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
