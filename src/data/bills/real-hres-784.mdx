## Congressional Research Service Summary

House Resolution 784 would have recognized the 2,560th birthday of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551-479 BC). The resolution cited Confucius's contributions to philosophy, education, and social thought, and noted the global influence of Confucian values including respect for elders, the importance of education, and ethical governance.

## Bill Details

The resolution attracted 41 cosponsors — a remarkable show of support for honoring a philosopher born over two and a half millennia ago. It was introduced during the same week as Confucius's birthday (September 28, 551 BC, by traditional accounts).

The resolution's preamble noted several key points:
- Confucius was born in 551 BC in what is now Qufu, Shandong Province, China
- His teachings have influenced billions of people over 2,500+ years
- Confucian values emphasize education, family, ethical governance, and social harmony
- The Confucian tradition has shaped Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese societies

## The Philosophy Question

While Confucius's contributions to human thought are beyond dispute, one might wonder whether the U.S. House of Representatives is the most efficient mechanism for conveying belated birthday greetings — 2,560 years belated, to be precise.

The resolution joins a long tradition of congressional commemorations for historical figures. Congress has passed resolutions honoring everyone from Renaissance artists to modern athletes. The question isn't whether Confucius deserves recognition, but whether the world's most powerful legislative body should spend time on resolutions that have no legal effect.

Confucius himself might have had thoughts on this. As recorded in the Analects: "The superior man acts before he speaks, and afterwards speaks according to his actions."

The resolution did not advance out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
