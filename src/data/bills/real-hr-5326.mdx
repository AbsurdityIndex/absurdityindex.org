## Congressional Research Service Summary

This appropriations bill funded the Commerce, Justice, and Science departments for FY2013. During floor debate, Rep. Jeff Flake successfully attached an amendment (passing 218-208) barring NSF from funding its political science program, citing examples of questionable grants including the now-famous $384,949 study of duck reproductive anatomy at Yale.

## Bill Details

The grant funded research by evolutionary biologist Patricia Brennan on the co-evolution of male and female reproductive anatomy in waterfowl. The research examined how an evolutionary "arms race" between the sexes shaped the unusual morphology of duck reproductive organs. The study was published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and contributed to understanding of sexual selection and evolutionary biology.

However, when the grant appeared in congressional "waste" reports, the headlines wrote themselves. Rep. Jeff Flake included it in his "Wastebook" highlights, and the study became a recurring example in debates over federal research spending priorities. Dr. Brennan wrote a public defense of her work, arguing that basic science research often appears frivolous to non-scientists but can yield important insights. The episode highlighted the tension between political accountability for public spending and the unpredictable nature of scientific inquiry.

> **Source:** The Flake amendment was attached to H.R. 5326 in the 112th Congress. The duck research was funded by NSF grant IOS-0920344. [View on Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/5326).
