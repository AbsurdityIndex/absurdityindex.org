## Section 1. Short Title and Ichthyological Alarm

This Act may be cited as the **"Suspicious Salmon Handling Prevention Act"** or the **"Something Fishy This Way Comes Act."**

> **REAL ABSURDITY NOTICE:** Section 32 of the United Kingdom's Salmon Act 1986 makes it an offense to "handle a salmon in suspicious circumstances." This is an actual law, passed by an actual Parliament, and enforceable by actual police officers who must, presumably, assess the suspiciousness of one's salmon-handling with a straight face.

## Section 2. Congressional Investigation into Suspicious Salmon

Congress, upon learning of this law, conducted a thorough investigation and now presents the following findings:

> (a) The Salmon Act 1986 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom and received Royal Assent, meaning the Queen herself technically approved a law about suspicious fish handling.
>
> (b) The Act does not define what constitutes "suspicious circumstances," leaving it to the professional judgment of law enforcement officers to determine whether a person's relationship with a salmon has crossed a line.
>
> (c) The law was originally intended to combat poaching and the sale of illegally caught salmon, which is reasonable, but the phrasing has achieved immortality for entirely different reasons.
>
> (d) At no point during the legislative process did anyone apparently say, "Perhaps we should word this differently."

## Section 3. What Constitutes Suspicious Salmon Handling?

### 3(a). Potentially Suspicious Scenarios

In the interest of public education, Congress offers the following hypothetical scenarios that might constitute suspicious salmon handling:

1. Carrying a salmon through a residential neighborhood at 3 AM while wearing a trench coat
2. Presenting a salmon at a job interview without explanation
3. Cradling a salmon in a blanket while whispering to it on public transport
4. Attempting to use a salmon as identification at a bank
5. Placing a salmon in a briefcase, glancing around nervously, and entering a government building
6. Holding a salmon behind your back when a police officer approaches

### 3(b). Probably Not Suspicious Scenarios

The following are likely acceptable forms of salmon interaction:

1. Purchasing a salmon from a fishmonger (normal)
2. Cooking a salmon (encouraged)
3. Catching a salmon with a valid fishing license (the entire point)
4. Displaying a salmon trophy on your wall (slightly sad, but legal)

### 3(c). The Gray Area

Congress acknowledges a vast middle ground of salmon-human interactions for which suspiciousness cannot be predetermined, including but not limited to:

- Speed-walking with a salmon
- Owning more than a reasonable number of salmon simultaneously
- Making prolonged eye contact with a salmon in a market
- Taking a salmon to the cinema

## Section 4. Enforcement Considerations

### 4(a). The Officer's Dilemma

Congress notes that the average British police officer must weigh the following when encountering a salmon situation:

1. Is a salmon present? (Prerequisite)
2. Is it being "handled"? (Broadly defined)
3. Are the circumstances "suspicious"? (Subjectively determined)
4. Can I write this report without laughing? (Unlikely)

### 4(b). Training Requirements

Any nation adopting similar legislation should ensure that law enforcement receives specialized training in:

- Salmon identification (to distinguish from trout, which is apparently fine to handle suspiciously)
- Circumstantial suspiciousness assessment
- Maintaining professional composure during fish-related interrogations
- Writing incident reports that include the word "salmon" more than four times without requesting a transfer

## Section 5. Sense of Congress

It is the sense of Congress that:

> (a) The United Kingdom's Salmon Act 1986 is a masterpiece of unintentional comedy and shall be studied in law schools as an example of what happens when legislative drafting goes beautifully wrong.
>
> (b) The United States shall not adopt similar legislation, not because suspicious salmon handling is acceptable, but because Congress has enough trouble legislating things that make sense.
>
> (c) Any salmon reading this should know that it is not under suspicion at this time.

*This resolution was passed by a vote of 389-41-5. The five abstentions were from representatives of major salmon-producing states who stated they "did not wish to comment on the matter at this time," which Congress found deeply suspicious.*
