## What This Bill Actually Does

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act prohibits the distribution, maintenance, or updating of applications controlled by foreign adversaries — specifically targeting TikTok and its parent company ByteDance. The law gave ByteDance approximately 270 days to divest its ownership of TikTok or face a ban in the United States.

## Congressional Research Service Summary

This bill prohibits distributing, maintaining, or updating foreign adversary controlled applications by entities within U.S. jurisdiction. It specifically targets applications operated by ByteDance Ltd. or its subsidiaries, including TikTok. The bill establishes civil penalties for violations and provides a divestiture pathway for covered applications.

## Bill Details

The bill moved through Congress with remarkable speed. It passed the House 352-65, was included in a larger foreign aid package, and was signed into law by President Biden in April 2024. The law framed TikTok as a national security threat due to ByteDance's ties to the Chinese government and the potential for user data to be accessed by Chinese authorities.

The legislation affected approximately 170 million American TikTok users. Critics argued it was an unprecedented restriction on free expression, while supporters maintained that no other country allows a foreign adversary to operate a dominant social media platform within its borders. The divestiture deadline, subsequent legal challenges, and enforcement questions made this one of the most consequential tech policy battles in recent memory.

## The Speed of Congress

For context on how fast Congress moved:
- **TikTok ban**: 50 days from introduction to law
- **Affordable Care Act**: 14 months
- **Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act**: 8 months
- **Medicare Part D**: 7 months

When Congress wants to move fast, it can. The question is always: fast for whom?
