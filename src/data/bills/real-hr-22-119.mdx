summary: "Requires documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections — passports, birth certificates, or REAL ID indicating citizenship. Passed the House 220-208."
theGist: "Non-citizen voting is already a federal crime punishable by up to 5 years in prison and permanent deportation. Every voter registration already requires a sworn attestation of citizenship under penalty of perjury. The Heritage Foundation's own fraud database found [77 cases of non-citizen voting over 24 years](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/myths-about-noncitizen-voting-heritage-foundation-data/) out of billions of ballots cast. Congress's solution: require ~160 million Americans to produce documents that [9-11% of eligible voters don't readily have](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-bills-would-require-passport-or-birth-certificate-register-vote). Only [48% of Americans](https://www.apolloacademy.com/48-of-americans-have-a-passport/) have a valid passport. Replacing a lost birth certificate costs $10-60 and takes up to 10 weeks — from the same government now requiring you to have it."
whyItMatters: "The bill would [effectively eliminate mail-in and online voter registration](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/save-act-would-undermine-voter-registration-all-americans) for federal elections, since applicants must present documents in person. An estimated [21 million eligible citizens](https://responsivegov.org/research/the-save-act-how-a-proof-of-citizenship-requirement-would-impact-elections/) lack easy access to the required documentation. Passport ownership skews heavily by income — only [1 in 5 Americans earning under $50K](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-overview-and-facts/) have one. The bill also creates a private right of action allowing anyone to sue election officials who register someone without proper proof."
crsSummary: "Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act or the SAVE ActThis bill requires individuals to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections.Specifically, the bill prohibits states from accepting and processing an application to register to vote in a federal election unless the applicant presents documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.&nbsp;The bill specifies what documents are considered acceptable proof of U.S. citizenship, such as&nbsp;identification that complies with the REAL ID Act of 2005 that indicates U.S. citizenship.Further, the bill (1) prohibits states from registering an individual to vote in a federal election unless, at the time the individual applies to register to vote, the individual provides documentary proof of U.S. citizenship; and (2) requires states to establish an alternative process under which an applicant may submit other evidence to demonstrate U.S. citizenship.Each state must take affirmative steps on an ongoing basis to ensure that only U.S. citizens are registered to vote, which shall include establishing a program to identify individuals who are not U.S. citizens using information supplied by certain sources.Additionally, states must remove noncitizens from their official lists of eligible voters.The bill allows for a private right of action against an election official who registers an applicant to vote in a federal election who fails to present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship.The bill establishes criminal penalties for certain offenses, including registering an applicant to vote in a federal election who fails to present documentary proof of U.S. citizenship."

## The Institutional Absurdity

The SAVE Act — "Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act" — requires documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. On its face, that sounds reasonable. But consider what already exists:

### What the Law Already Says

Under the [National Voter Registration Act of 1993](https://www.justice.gov/crt/national-voter-registration-act-1993-nvra), every voter registration application must:

1. State each eligibility requirement, including citizenship
2. Contain an attestation that the applicant meets each requirement
3. State the penalties for a false application
4. Require the applicant's **signature under penalty of perjury**

Non-citizen voting is already illegal under [18 U.S.C. § 611](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/611) (up to 1 year in prison) and [18 U.S.C. § 1015(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1015) (up to 5 years in prison). Any non-citizen who votes faces permanent deportation and a lifetime ban from the United States.

### The Scale of the Problem vs. the Solution

The Heritage Foundation — which maintains a database specifically to document voter fraud — found [77 instances of non-citizen voting across 24 years](https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/blog/myths-about-noncitizen-voting-heritage-foundation-data/) out of billions of ballots cast. The Brennan Center's [2016 survey](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-vanishingly-rare) of 23.5 million votes found approximately 30 suspected incidents — a rate of 0.0001%.

The SAVE Act's solution would require approximately 160 million Americans to locate and present citizenship documents. An estimated [9-11% of eligible voters](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-bills-would-require-passport-or-birth-certificate-register-vote) don't readily have them. Only [48% of Americans](https://www.apolloacademy.com/48-of-americans-have-a-passport/) have a valid passport, and ownership [skews heavily by income](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-overview-and-facts/) — only 1 in 5 Americans earning under $50,000 have one.

### The Bureaucratic Catch-22

Need a replacement birth certificate? That'll be $10-60 and up to 10 weeks by mail — from the same government that's now requiring you to have it handy. Changed your name through marriage? You'll need additional documents to bridge the gap between your birth certificate and current ID.

The bill passed the House [220-208](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2025102) and is pending in the Senate.
