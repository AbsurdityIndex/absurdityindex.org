## Overview

The Rules of the House of Representatives are adopted by resolution at the start of each new Congress. While largely carried over from the previous Congress, each rules package includes changes reflecting the priorities of the incoming majority and any deals made during Speaker elections.

The 119th Congress rules package was adopted on January 3, 2025, after a relatively smooth Speaker election compared to the chaos of the 118th Congress.

## Key Changes from 118th Congress

### Motion to Vacate Reform

After the historic removal of Speaker McCarthy in the 118th Congress using a single-member motion to vacate, this rules package raised the threshold to 9 members of the majority party. This change was intended to provide stability while preserving some accountability mechanism.

### Committee Jurisdiction Updates

Minor reshuffling of committee jurisdictions, including:
- Expanded Homeland Security Committee jurisdiction over AI and emerging technology security
- Clarified Financial Services Committee authority over cryptocurrency regulation
- Moved some environmental review provisions from Natural Resources to Transportation

### Budget Enforcement

New requirements for CBO scoring before floor votes aim to prevent "surprise" spending bills. However, exemptions for "time-sensitive" legislation effectively preserve leadership discretion to bypass these requirements.

## Standing Rules Summary

The House operates under 28 standing rules covering everything from the Speaker's powers to the conduct of members on the floor. Notable provisions include:

- **Rule I:** The Speaker administers the oath of office and "shall preserve order and decorum"
- **Rule VIII:** Response to subpoenas requires House authorization
- **Rule XXIII:** The Code of Official Conduct (ethics rules)
- **Rule XXVII:** Broadcasting of House proceedings
