## Overview

The 118th Congress rules package will be remembered for two things: the chaotic 15-ballot Speaker election that preceded it, and the single-member motion to vacate that ultimately ended Speaker McCarthy's tenure.

After four days and 15 rounds of voting, Kevin McCarthy secured the Speaker's gavel by making unprecedented concessions to hardline conservatives. These concessions were codified in H.Res. 5, creating a rules framework that prioritized minority faction leverage over governing stability.

## The 15-Ballot Speaker Election

Before the rules could even be adopted, the House had to elect a Speaker. For the first time since 1923, this required multiple ballots:

- **Ballots 1-11:** McCarthy fell short as 20 hardliners withheld support
- **Ballots 12-14:** Deals begin to form, holdouts shrink
- **Ballot 15:** McCarthy wins 216-212 after final concessions

The concessions made during this process shaped the entire 118th Congress.

## Key Provisions

### Motion to Vacate

The most consequential change allowed any single member to force a vote to remove the Speaker. On October 3, 2023, Rep. Matt Gaetz invoked this provision, leading to McCarthy's removal by a 216-210 vote. This was the first successful motion to vacate in U.S. history.

### Freedom Caucus Leverage

Guaranteed Rules Committee seats for hardline members meant that no bill could reach the floor without their implicit approval. This created repeated showdowns over basic government functions.

### Holman Rule

This obscure 19th-century rule allows appropriations amendments to target individual federal employees' salaries. Its revival signaled intent to pursue aggressive oversight and potential retaliation against specific officials.

## Legacy

The 118th Congress rules package stands as a cautionary tale about trading governance for votes. The provisions designed to empower a small faction ultimately paralyzed the chamber, led to the first-ever Speaker removal, and created weeks of leadership vacuum.
