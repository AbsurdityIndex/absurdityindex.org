          It took four months of arguments in a closed room, counted enslaved people as three-fifths
          of a person, left out a Bill of Rights, and has been amended 27 times in 235 years. It's
          still the most influential governance document ever written — not because it was perfect,
          but because it was concrete enough to argue about, ratify, and then fix.

        <p class="mb-4">
          <strong>This document is wrong too.</strong> Parts of it, anyway. I know that because nothing

          But for 20 years I've heard "elections are broken" from every direction — and not a single

            fast asynchronous review
          </li>
          <li>Designed so no single operator category can unilaterally finalize records</li>
          <li>Doesn't track how you vote</li>
          <li>No direct fee to voters; funded through public budgets</li>

                it, poke holes in it, and make it better.
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Why was it written?</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                For a really long time, grown-ups have been saying "voting is broken!" but nobody
                ever drew up a plan to fix any part of it. This is someone finally saying "okay,
                here's a plan — tell me what's wrong with it."
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it works:</p>
              <p class="mb-3">Imagine voting is like borrowing a library book.</p>

              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>You make your library card one time.</strong> You prove who you are once — then
                  after that, you just show your card. No need to bring your birth certificate every time
                  you want a book.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>A big shared notebook keeps track.</strong> 74 different librarians all have
                  a copy of the same notebook, and they all have to agree before anything gets written
                  down. No single librarian can cheat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>The notebook doesn't say which stories you like.</strong> It only knows <em
                    >that</em
                  > a book was checked out — not which one. Your reading habits are your business.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong
                    >If somebody tries to check out two books at once, it gets caught right away.</strong
                  > The notebook sees the duplicate instantly — not weeks later.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>If something looks weird, you still get a temporary pass</strong> while the
                  adults figure it out. You never get turned away with nothing.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="mb-3">
                VoteChain tries to do exactly this for voting: prove who you are <strong
                  >once</strong
                >, catch cheating <strong>fast</strong>, and never take away your right to vote
                while things get sorted out.
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">"But doesn't it know all my stuff?"</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Nope. Think of it this way: the library already has your name and address on file —
                that's how you got your card. But the <strong>notebook</strong> only says "someone checked
                out a book." Not your name. Not which book. VoteChain is the notebook, not the library's
                filing cabinet. Your personal info stays where it already is. The notebook only knows:
                <em>allowed to borrow? yes or no.</em>
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Who makes sure it's working right?</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Every three months, an outside group checks everything — like a surprise inspection.
                And here's the cool part: <strong>25 regular people are picked at random</strong> (like
                jury duty!) to choose <em>which</em> group does the inspection. So the people in charge
                don't get to pick their own inspector. And the inspection results? Posted for everyone
                to see.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Also, <strong>all the instructions for how the system works are public.</strong> Anyone
                can look at them. It's like if the recipe for the school lunch was posted on the wall
                so every parent could read it. The system belongs to everyone — not a company, not the
                government, everyone.
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Some quick numbers:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Costs about <strong>$5.60 per vote</strong> to run — we already spend $4-6 billion each
                  election cycle
                </li>
                <li>
                  Would take about <strong>5 years</strong> to build and roll out to all 50 states
                </li>
                <li>
                  Under <strong>60 seconds</strong> at the polls — faster than the current ID check
                </li>
                <li><strong>Free</strong> for voters — enrollment, secure cards, everything</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">What it doesn't do:</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                It doesn't change how you vote or count your ballot. It doesn't track who you voted
                for. It doesn't cost you a cent. It doesn't need a smartphone. And it doesn't let
                any one person or party run the show.

              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">What is this?</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                A complete technical blueprint — a detailed plan for building a system that verifies
                voters are who they say they are. It's not a law. It's not software you can
                download. It's a proposal that anyone can read, tear apart, and improve. Think of it
                like an architect's drawings for a building that hasn't been built yet.
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Why does it exist?</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                For 20 years, people across the political spectrum have said "elections are broken"
                — but nobody has published a concrete, buildable plan to fix any part of it. This
                document tries to change that. It tackles one specific piece: verifying that every
                person who votes is a citizen, is eligible, is alive, and hasn't already voted — and
                doing it in a way that's fast, private, and not controlled by any single party or
                agency.
              </p>

              <p class="mb-3">
                <strong
                  >VoteChain is a voter <em>verification</em> system — not a voting machine.</strong
                > It doesn't touch your ballot. It sits alongside existing election infrastructure and
                answers four questions with mathematical proof: Are you a citizen? Are you eligible? Are
                you alive? Have you already voted?
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">"But what about my personal data?"</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                This is the part most people get wrong, so let's get ahead of it. Think of voter
                verification as having two sides. On the <strong>left side</strong>, yes — the
                government already collects your personal information. Social Security numbers,
                birth certificates, passports. That happens today, right now, and VoteChain doesn't
                change any of it. On the <strong>right side</strong> is the only question this system
                actually answers: <em>are you verified — yes or no?</em>
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                VoteChain lives <strong>entirely on that right side</strong>. It receives a
                cryptographic "yes, this person checks out" — and that's all it stores. No names. No
                Social Security numbers. No addresses. No biometrics. Just math that proves someone
                was verified, without revealing who they are. Your personal data stays where it
                already is — locked in existing government databases that already have it. VoteChain
                never sees it, never touches it, and is architecturally incapable of storing it.
              </p>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it works:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  Enroll <strong>once</strong> through multi-source identity checks (Social Security,
                  immigration services, birth certificates, passport records). This generates a <strong
                    >digital credential</strong
                  > — think of it as a secure digital key that only you hold, proving you're a verified
                  voter without carrying a physical ID to the polls.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the polls, the system uses something called a <strong
                    >zero-knowledge proof</strong
                  >. In plain English: it's a way for the system to confirm "yes, this person is
                  eligible to vote" <em>without revealing who they are</em>. The poll worker sees a
                  green light or a red light — not your name, not your address, nothing personal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Every verification event is recorded on an <strong>immutable ledger</strong> — a shared
                  digital record book that 74 separate computers (run by federal, state, and independent
                  auditor organizations) all have to agree on before anything gets written. Once it's
                  written, nobody can go back and change it. That's what "blockchain" means here — not
                  crypto coins, just a tamper-proof record.
                </li>
                <li>
                  No single agency, party, or official can control the system. Finalizing any record
                  requires <strong>3 of 4 independent operator groups</strong> to agree — federal nodes,
                  state nodes, auditor nodes, and oversight nodes.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">How it catches fraud:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Instantly at the polls:</strong> If someone tries to vote twice, the system
                  catches it in seconds. Each voter gets a unique one-time-use digital token (called a
                  "nullifier") for each election. Try to use it twice? The math doesn't lie — the conflict
                  is flagged immediately.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>In the background (hours, not months):</strong> Death records, court records,
                  and suspicious patterns are checked continuously. Today, dead voters can stay on the
                  rolls for months or years. This system targets flagging them within 48 hours of a death
                  record arriving.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Six types of fraud are actively monitored: deceased voters, duplicate voting,
                  geographic impossibility (voting in two places too far apart too fast),
                  statistical anomalies, enrollment fraud, and court-record mismatches.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Privacy protections:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>No personal information on the shared ledger. Ever.</strong> No names, Social
                  Security numbers, addresses, or fingerprints. The blockchain only stores math — proofs
                  that someone was verified, not who they are.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fingerprint/biometric enrollment is <strong>optional</strong>. If you don't want
                  to use biometrics, you can use a PIN + a free secure card + a poll worker
                  confirming you're physically present. Both paths have equal legal standing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Ballot secrecy is <strong>built into the architecture</strong>, not just promised
                  by policy. The verification system and the ballot system are completely separate.
                  VoteChain knows <em>that</em> you voted — it has no way of knowing <em>how</em> you
                  voted.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">Who audits the system?</p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Trust doesn't come from the people who built it telling you to trust it. So the
                blueprint proposes this: <strong
                  >every quarter, an independent third-party firm audits the entire system</strong
                > — the code, the data, the processes, everything. The audit must be completed within
                30 days and the full results published publicly.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Here's the part that matters: <strong>the public picks the auditor.</strong> Any qualified
                U.S. security firm can volunteer. Then <strong
                  >25 people are chosen at random from across the country</strong
                > — like jury duty, but for choosing the watchdog. Those 25 citizens review the candidates
                and vote on which firm gets the job. No government committee choosing its own auditor.
                No single online poll that bots can flood. Just 25 randomly selected Americans deciding
                who checks the homework.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                A different firm each quarter means no auditor gets cozy with the system they're
                reviewing. And because the results are public, anyone — journalists, academics, your
                neighbor who's really into spreadsheets — can read exactly what was found.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Oh, and <strong>the entire system is open source.</strong> Every line of code, every smart
                contract, every configuration file — published publicly for anyone to inspect, audit,
                or fork. You don't have to take anyone's word for what the system does. You can read it
                yourself or hire someone who can. No black boxes. No proprietary secrets. No "trust us."
                If a security researcher in their garage finds a flaw at 2 AM, they can prove it with
                the actual code. The system belongs to the people — not a contractor, not an agency, not
                a party. It's public infrastructure, built in the open, owned by everyone.

              <p class="mb-3">
                A 1,525-line PRD specifying a permissioned blockchain-based voter verification
                layer. Not a voting system — a verification-only layer that sits alongside existing
                election infrastructure. This document is a buildable blueprint: architecture, data
                schemas, threat models, cost models, rollout phases, and 14 open questions. Intended
                to be forked, red-teamed, and iterated on publicly.

              <p class="font-bold text-navy-900 mt-4 mb-2">
                PII boundary (critical architectural constraint):
              </p>
              <p class="mb-3">
                Strict separation between the <strong>identity enrollment plane</strong> (where PII exists
                — SSA, USCIS, state vital records, encrypted state enrollment vaults) and the <strong
                  >verification plane</strong
                > (VoteChain itself). The chain never ingests, stores, or transmits PII. DID-to-PII linkage
                exists only in state-operated encrypted vaults, accessible exclusively by court order.
                The verification plane operates solely on cryptographic attestations: ZKPs, nullifiers,
                and DID-anchored proofs. This is an architectural invariant, not a policy promise.
              </p>

                  >VoteChain is a permissioned blockchain-based voter verification layer</strong
                > implementing five cryptographic attestation pillars. It is not a ballot-casting or counting
                system — it answers four eligibility questions with cryptographic proof and records every
                verification event on an immutable, multi-party-consensus ledger.

              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Consortium chain</strong> (Hyperledger Fabric-class): 74-node BFT network —
                  6 federal (EAC/CISA), 50 state, 12 independent auditor, 6 congressional oversight. Category-quorum
                  consensus: 3-of-4 categories, each requiring &ge;2/3 intra-category agreement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Identity layer:</strong> W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) with voter-held
                  private keys (device or HSM-backed secure card). DID-to-PII linkage exists only in encrypted
                  state enrollment vaults, accessible by court order.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Privacy layer:</strong> zk-SNARKs (circuit proves all five pillar attestations
                  valid for a given election_id + jurisdiction_id without disclosing voter identity).
                  Nullifier = deterministic hash(DID + election_id) for cross-jurisdictional duplicate
                  detection on the national channel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Data model:</strong> Per-state channels for eligibility chaincode (statute-versioned
                  judicial rulesets); one national channel for nullifier dedup and cross-state fraud correlation.
                  Target: 10,000+ TPS, &lt;3s finality.

              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2.5 mb-4">
                <li>
                  <strong>Citizenship:</strong> 2-of-4 source attestation at enrollment (SSA, USCIS, state
                  vital records, State Dept passport records). Attestation bound to DID, 10-year expiry.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Eligibility:</strong> Per-election smart contract evaluation — age, residency,
                  judicial status (felony disenfranchisement, restoration, court adjudications), registration.
                  Stale/conflicting data defaults to provisional + adjudication SLA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Liveness &amp; Presence:</strong> Biometric (local template match on voter device,
                  never centralized) or non-biometric first-class path (knowledge factor + possession
                  factor + poll worker attestation). Continuous death-record feed integration with &lt;48h
                  revocation SLA.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Duplicate Prevention:</strong> One-time nullifier checked against national channel
                  pre-ballot-issuance. Cross-state duplicate detection in real-time — cryptographically
                  infeasible to generate a second valid nullifier for same DID + election_id.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Chain-of-Custody:</strong> Device DIDs with HSM attestation co-sign all verification
                  events. Compromised device &rarr; attestation revocation + retroactive flag of all prior
                  verifications.

                  and timestamp. Resolutions: confirmed fraud (DOJ/AG referral), false positive (reason
