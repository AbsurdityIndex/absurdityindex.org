# Absurdity Index

> A satirical commentary site that scores real federal legislation on an Absurdity Index (1-10), paired with tongue-in-cheek satirical bills that actually make common sense. Non-partisan. Every factual claim includes a proof link to authoritative sources (congress.gov, law.cornell.edu).

The Absurdity Index reads actual congressional bills and rates them on a 1-10 absurdity scale based on wasteful spending, tortured acronyms, time spent vs. importance, actual impact vs. stated goals, and unintended consequences. Scores are editorial opinion, not objective fact. The site also publishes satirical "Not Bills" — legislation so reasonable that no actual Congress would ever pass it.
