## Mission

The Absurdity Index exists to:
- Make congressional records accessible to humans without law degrees
- Score real federal legislation on a 1-10 absurdity scale
- Highlight wasteful, illogical, or absurd federal spending and legislation
- Publish satirical "Not Bills" — legislation so reasonable no actual Congress would pass it
- Encourage public participation in legislative analysis
- Maintain strict non-partisan absurdity analysis

Every factual claim on the site includes a proof link to authoritative sources such as congress.gov, law.cornell.edu, .gov press releases, and clerk.house.gov roll calls. If a source cannot be found, the claim is not made.

## Bill Types

The site features three types of bills:

### Real Bills
Actual federal legislation sourced from Congress.gov. Each real bill includes:
- An Absurdity Index score (1-10)
- Sponsor name, party (R/D/I), and state
- Congress number and committee assignments
- Vote records (yeas, nays, passed status, roll call number)
- Pork barrel spending tracking (total pork, per capita)
- Bill evolution stages with amendments
- Direct link to the full text on Congress.gov
- Plain language summary

### Sensible Bills ("Not Bills")
Satirical legislative proposals that make common sense. These are tongue-in-cheek bills written as if they were real legislation, but their proposals are so fundamentally obvious and reasonable that no actual Congress would ever pass them. Examples include requiring bills to be read before voting on them, or mandating that government websites work on modern browsers.

### Absurd Bills
Purely fictional satirical bills that push absurdity to its logical extreme for comedic effect.

## Scoring Methodology

The Absurdity Index uses a 1-10 scale divided into four tiers:

### 1-3: Suspiciously Reasonable
Legislation that accidentally makes sense. Post office namings, routine budget authorizations, and other bills that somehow slipped through without being loaded with riders. We score these low not because they're unimportant, but because they're suspiciously functional.

### 4-6: Pork-Adjacent
Bills flirting with absurdity. Creative acronyms (COVFEFE Act, COVFEFE = Communications Over Various Feeds Electronically For Engagement), suspiciously specific regulations, and bills that make you wonder if someone lost a bet.

### 7-8: Hold My Gavel
Genuinely reckless legislating. This is where bills start costing real money for questionable purposes. Think pork barrel projects, studies on things that don't need studying, and legislative priorities that make you question the democratic process.

### 9-10: Fish on Meth
Peak absurdity. The pinnacle of legislative dysfunction. Named after a real government-funded study that put fish on methamphetamine. This tier is reserved for bills so absurd that satire writers couldn't make them up.

### Scoring Criteria
When scoring a bill, the site considers:
- Wasteful spending relative to the bill's stated purpose
- Tortured acronyms and creative naming
- Time spent by Congress vs. importance of the issue
- Actual impact vs. stated goals
- Unintended consequences (real or potential)
- Presence of unrelated riders or pork barrel items
- Creative lobbying influence

Scores are explicitly editorial opinion, not objective fact. Non-partisan absurdity is a core principle — both parties produce equally absurd legislation.
