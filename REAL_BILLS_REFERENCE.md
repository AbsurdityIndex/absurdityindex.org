## 11. Congressional Gym Access During Shutdowns

| **Category** | Ethics |
| **Tags** | government shutdown, congressional gym, congressional perks, ethics, hypocrisy |
| **Absurdity Index** | 4/10 |
| **Pork Rating** | $1M |

### Summary
During the 2013 government shutdown, 800,000 federal workers were furloughed — but Congress kept its exclusive gym (with pool, sauna, paddleball court) open. This resolution would have closed it. Referred to the committee that controls gym access. They did not act.

### Note
[WARN] **API Verification Failed**: H.Res. 559 in the 113th Congress is "Día de los Niños" by Rep. Hinojosa. The gym resolution may have a different bill number or may be a composite of the shutdown controversy.

### Summary

## 13. Duck Genitalia Study (NSF)

| **Tags** | nsf, research funding, ducks, government waste, science |
| **Absurdity Index** | 8/10 |
| **Pork Rating** | $384,949 |

### Summary
Sought NSF reform after $384,949 went to studying duck reproductive anatomy. The research was peer-reviewed and scientifically valid (examining evolutionary "arms race" in waterfowl reproduction). The researcher defended her work; the bill did not advance.

### Note
[WARN] **API Verification Failed**: H.R. 5717 in the 112th Congress is "Army Corps of Engineers Communications Accountability Act" by Rep. Kristi Noem. The NSF-related bill may have a different number or be a composite of Jeff Flake's "Wastebook" campaign against NSF spending.

| **Absurdity Index** | 7/10 |
| **Pork Rating** | $682,570 |

### Summary
Targeted NSF spending after the "shrimp on a treadmill" viral video. The $682,570 grant funded legitimate research on water quality's effect on marine organism health. The treadmill itself cost about $47 and was built from spare parts.

### Note
**Corrected**: Bill number was H.R. 3899 (which is the Voting Rights Amendment Act). The actual FIRST Act of 2014 is H.R. 4186 sponsored by Rep. Larry Bucshon (R-IN). The "shrimp on treadmill" controversy was also highlighted in other legislative efforts.

| **Title** | Methamphetamine Response Through Investigating Drug Sources Act |
| **Subtitle** | Tracking Supply Chains While Fish Track Withdrawal |
| **Year Introduced** | 2024 |

### Note
[WARN] **API Verification Failed**: H.R. 8752 in the 118th Congress is "Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2025" by Rep. Mark Amodei. The meth investigation bill may have a different bill number or may be a composite.
