## Outreach Tips

1. **Send easy targets first.** Community colleges and smaller schools respond faster and are more likely to add resources without committee review. Build a track record before approaching Ivy League and government institutions.

2. **Personalize every email.** Reference the specific guide page and section. Librarians can tell when they receive a mass email.

3. **Follow up once.** If no response after 2 weeks, send a brief follow-up. Do not follow up more than once.

4. **Track additions.** When a LibGuide adds the site, screenshot it and note the date. This creates social proof for harder targets ("Already listed on X university's LibGuide").

5. **Time it right.** Send emails at the start of semesters (August/September or January/February) when librarians are updating guides for new courses.

6. **Do not mass-email.** Send one at a time, spaced at least a day apart. Librarians in the same professional networks talk to each other.

7. **Offer to provide a description.** Librarians often copy the blurb directly. Provide a concise, neutral, 2-sentence description they can use:
   > "Absurdity Index is a non-partisan site that scores real congressional legislation on an absurdity scale, with every bill linked to its source on congress.gov. Features include a bill comparison tool, civics quiz, and plain-language bill breakdowns with vote counts and sponsor data."
