**Expert Name / Title:**
Creator of the Absurdity Index

**Bio (150 words):**

> Creator of the Absurdity Index (absurdityindex.org), a data-driven satirical commentary platform that scores real federal legislation on an absurdity scale. The site pairs actual congressional bills -- sourced and linked directly from Congress.gov -- with satirical "common sense" legislation to highlight how disconnected lawmaking can be from everyday life. With deep expertise in the legislative process, government spending analysis, and civic technology, the Absurdity Index uses humor and transparency to make federal policy accessible to audiences who have tuned out traditional political coverage. Every factual claim on the site is backed by an authoritative proof link, maintaining a rigorous evidence standard that most satirical outlets do not. The project has cataloged dozens of real bills, built interactive tools including a bill comparison engine, absurdity scoring methodology, and legislative trend tracker, and cultivated an engaged audience that cares about accountability without partisan framing.

**Areas of Expertise:**
- Congressional legislation and the federal legislative process
- Government spending and budget absurdity
- Political satire and civic engagement through humor
- Civic technology and open government data
- Government accountability and transparency
- Media literacy and misinformation in political coverage

**Talking Points (5 Bullet Points):**

1. **Every real bill on the site links to Congress.gov** -- the Absurdity Index maintains a strict evidence standard where no factual claim is published without an authoritative proof link, a practice most media outlets and satirical sites skip entirely.
2. **Satire as a civic engagement tool** -- research shows humor lowers barriers to political participation; the Absurdity Index uses scored absurdity ratings and satirical counter-legislation to make policy debates accessible to disengaged audiences.
3. **Data-driven absurdity scoring** -- each real bill receives a transparent absurdity score based on documented methodology, moving political commentary from opinion into structured, reproducible analysis.
4. **Non-partisan by design** -- the site scores legislation from both parties and avoids partisan framing, focusing on the substance of what Congress actually does rather than which team proposed it.
5. **Civic tech innovation** -- the platform includes interactive features like bill comparison tools, legislative trend trackers, cost calculators, and a bill submission system, demonstrating that civic technology does not have to be boring or inaccessible.

**Headline:**
New Satirical Site Scores Real Congressional Bills on "Absurdity Index"

**Subheadline:**
Data-driven platform pairs actual federal legislation with satirical counter-bills to highlight the gap between lawmaking and common sense

**Full Press Release Body:**

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

A new satirical commentary platform is doing something no one in Washington seems willing to do: reading the bills and scoring them honestly.

The Absurdity Index (https://absurdityindex.org) launches as a free, publicly accessible site that takes real federal legislation -- sourced and linked directly from Congress.gov -- and scores each bill on a transparent absurdity scale. Alongside the real bills, the site publishes satirical "common sense" legislation: fictional bills designed to highlight how disconnected actual lawmaking has become from the everyday concerns of American citizens.

"The goal is not to tell people what to think about any particular bill or party," said the site's creator. "The goal is to make it easy to see what Congress is actually doing, in language that does not require a law degree, and to ask a simple question: does this make sense?"

Unlike traditional political satire that relies on hot takes and partisan framing, the Absurdity Index maintains a strict evidence standard. Every factual claim is backed by an authoritative proof link -- to Congress.gov, official roll call votes, or government press releases. The absurdity scoring methodology is documented and published on the site, so readers can evaluate the reasoning for themselves.

The platform features interactive tools designed to make legislation accessible: a bill comparison engine, a legislative cost calculator, a trend tracker that maps absurdity over time, and a public submission system that lets anyone nominate a bill for scoring. The site is built on modern civic technology -- Astro, Tailwind CSS, and Cloudflare -- and is engineered for speed, accessibility, and transparency.

With dozens of real bills already cataloged and scored, the Absurdity Index covers topics ranging from government spending and regulatory overreach to technology policy and ethics. The site is non-partisan by design, scoring legislation from both major parties based on the substance of what each bill actually proposes.

The Absurdity Index arrives at a moment when public trust in Congress sits near historic lows, yet voter engagement with actual legislation remains minimal. By combining humor, data, and rigorous sourcing, the platform aims to re-engage audiences who have tuned out traditional political coverage.

The site also publishes a companion browser extension for Congress.gov, providing absurdity scores and context directly on official legislation pages, and maintains an active presence on social media where individual bill analyses are shared with proof links.

The Absurdity Index is free to use, requires no account, and is updated regularly with new legislation.
