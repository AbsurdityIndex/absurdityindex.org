### Post 1
Congress has passed a bill 4 times that addresses 0.0001% of votes cast. They have never passed a bill requiring their own background checks.

One of these is a crisis. The other is a career.

Things that require more vetting than serving in Congress:

- Driving for Uber
- Volunteering at a school
- Adopting a rescue dog
- Getting TSA PreCheck
- Coaching Little League

H.R. 2026 would fix this. It was defeated 0-435.

80 organizations. Same talking points. Same 48-hour window. $590 million in dark money.

They call it "grassroots."

We call it a flock.

The STOCK Act required Congress to disclose trades in real time. Congress gutted it in 2013 via voice vote. It took 14 seconds. No debate. No names on record.

They exempted themselves from their own transparency law faster than you can microwave a Hot Pocket.

A quiz before you tweet "common sense" about a bill you haven't read.

Radical? Maybe.

More radical than spending $590M to coordinate 80 organizations saying the same thing on the same day? Debatable.

Ross Ulbricht: 240 years for building a website.

The federal agents investigating him who stole Bitcoin: 71 months.

Congress requires zero background checks to write the laws that produced both sentences.

The Parroting Severity Index, rated 1-10:

1 — Independently researched
5 — Retweeted someone who read an article
9 — Identical to 47 other accounts
10 — Called opponents TRAITORS in all caps

Laws Congress has exempted itself from:

- FOIA
- OSHA
- The STOCK Act (after gutting it)
- Parts of the Civil Rights Act (until 1995)
- Whistleblower protections

Laws Congress wants you to follow:
- All of them

Kansas tried proof-of-citizenship voting requirements.

Results:
- 31,000 citizens blocked from registering
- 0 elections changed by noncitizens
- Program ended by court order

Congress introduced the same bill 4 more times anyway.

### Post 10
The first unanimous vote of the 119th Congress wasn't about healthcare, the economy, or national security.

It was 435 members voting against their own background checks.

Bipartisanship is alive and well when it counts.

### Post 11
Heritage Foundation's own database: ~3 cases of noncitizen voting per year.

Congressional response: introduce the same bill 4 times, spend $4.2M per House passage, coordinate 80 organizations, and generate 3.3 billion views on social media.

Cost per noncitizen vote prevented: incalculable, because none were prevented.

### Post 12
Your Uber driver has passed a more rigorous background check than your congressman.

That's not a joke. That's federal law.

H.R. 2026 would change this. Congress voted 0-435 against it.

### Post 13
A bill has been introduced 4 times.
Passed the House twice.
Died in the Senate twice.
Expanded and reintroduced.
Folded into another bill.

At some point legislation becomes a subscription service.

The Accountability Comparison Index ranks vetting rigor in America:

Tier 1: FBI agent, foster parent
Tier 2: Airline pilot, teacher
Tier 3: Uber driver, gun purchaser
Tier 4: TSA PreCheck, cosmetologist
Tier 5: United States Congress
Tier 6: (Still searching for something less vetted)

### Post 15
When one person says "common sense," it's an opinion.
When 80 organizations say "common sense" in 48 hours using identical language funded by $590M in dark money, it's a campaign.

When they call it grassroots, it's comedy.

### Post 16
Congress swears an oath to uphold the Constitution.

No one checks if they've read it.

This is the governmental equivalent of agreeing to Terms of Service without scrolling down.

### Post 17
The SAVE Act would block 21 million Americans who lack passports from registering to vote.

To stop 3 people per year.

That's a 7,000,000-to-1 collateral damage ratio. The Pentagon would call that unacceptable. Congress calls it "common sense."

### Post 18
A convicted felon can't vote in most states.

A convicted felon can serve in Congress in all 50.

We built a system where the people writing the rules are the least accountable to them.

### Post 19
If you post "common sense" about a bill you haven't read, the PARROT Act would require you to:

1. Pass a quiz on the bill's actual provisions
2. Explain how it differs from existing law
3. Acknowledge the Heritage Foundation's own data
4. Form one original thought

Expected pass rate: 3%.

### Post 20
Congress held its first unanimous vote of the session.

Not on healthcare. Not on the economy. Not on national defense.

435 members agreed on one thing: they should not be subject to background checks.

The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed — to protect itself.
