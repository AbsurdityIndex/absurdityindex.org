<!-- ==============================
     RESUBMISSION TEMPLATE
     DO NOT resubmit until independent refs are filled in.
     Replace INDEPENDENT_SOURCE_1/2/3 with real citations.
     ============================== -->

The '''Absurdity Index''' is an American [[satirical news|political satire]] and [[civic technology]] website that scores real [[United States federal legislation|federal legislation]] on a 1–10 "absurdity" scale.<ref name="ind1"><!-- INDEPENDENT_SOURCE_1: Replace with independent press/media citation --></ref> The site also publishes satirical bills—fictional legislation framed as common-sense policy proposals—alongside its analysis of actual [[United States Congress|congressional]] bills.<ref name="about">{{cite web |url=https://absurdityindex.org/about/ |title=About This Institution |website=Absurdity Index |access-date=2026-02-11}}</ref>

== Background ==

The Absurdity Index launched in 2025 as an [[open-source software|open-source]] project.<ref name="ind1" /> The site uses a 1–10 scoring system with four tiers, ranging from "Suspiciously Reasonable" (routine legislation) to "Fish on Meth" (the highest absurdity rating, named after a federally funded study on the effects of [[methamphetamine]] on [[zebrafish]]).<ref name="ind2"><!-- INDEPENDENT_SOURCE_2: Replace with independent press/media citation --></ref><ref name="methodology">{{cite web |url=https://absurdityindex.org/how-we-score/ |title=How We Score |website=Absurdity Index |access-date=2026-02-11}}</ref>

Scores are based on five factors: wasteful spending, tortured acronyms, time spent relative to importance, actual versus stated impact, and unintended consequences. The site labels all scores as editorial opinion.<ref name="methodology" />

== Content ==

{{As of|2026|02}}, the site has scored over 30 real bills from the [[117th United States Congress|117th]], [[118th United States Congress|118th]], and [[119th United States Congress|119th]] Congresses, and published over 25 satirical bills.<ref name="about" /> Each real bill entry links to its page on [[Congress.gov]].<ref name="about" />

The site describes itself as non-partisan, applying its scoring criteria across party lines.<ref name="ind1" />

== Reception ==

<!-- This section is CRITICAL for notability. Fill in once independent coverage exists. -->

## Post-Decline Analysis (2026-02-11)

**Declined by:** [45dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:45dogs) — *"Currently doesn't have any independent sources."*

**Decline category:** [Non-notable web content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(web))

**What went wrong with the submission:**
The version submitted to Wikipedia was MORE detailed than the trimmed draft above. It re-added:
- Promotional language ("so reasonable that no actual Congress would ever pass")
- Full technical architecture details (CI/CD, Kubernetes, Zod, Tailwind)
- Expanded Features section (quiz, search, llms.txt, RSS, comparison tool)
- X Developer Community reference (still a self-posted source)
- The `{{third-party}}` tag was NOT included in the submitted version

**Root cause:** All 8 references cited absurdityindex.org, its GitHub, or a self-posted forum thread. Zero independent third-party sources exist.

**What's needed before resubmission:**
1. **2-3 articles in independent publications** — The Hill, Ars Technica, Wired, GovFresh, StateScoop, Government Technology
2. **Listing in a notable curated directory** — Civic Tech Field Guide (submitted), Media Bias/Fact Check (pre-filled)
3. **Any podcast interview, conference presentation, or academic citation**
4. Once independent sources exist, rewrite the article to cite THOSE as primary references
5. Use absurdityindex.org citations only for basic facts (launch date, content counts)

**Resubmission rules:**
- Do NOT resubmit until at least 2 independent sources are secured
- The article must be built AROUND the independent sources, not around the site's own pages
- Keep the article concise — a shorter well-sourced article beats a long self-sourced one
- Include `{{third-party}}` if sourcing is still thin

## Notability Checklist

Wikipedia requires **significant coverage in reliable, independent sources** for standalone articles. You need at least 2–3 checked off before resubmitting:

- [ ] News article in a recognized publication (The Hill, Politico, Ars Technica, Wired, NPR, Roll Call)
- [ ] Review or profile in a journalism/media/tech publication
- [ ] Coverage by a government transparency or civic tech organization
- [ ] Inclusion in Civic Tech Field Guide (submitted — follow up)
- [ ] Academic citation or mention in a research paper
- [ ] Mention in a podcast or broadcast with notable audience
- [ ] Coverage picked up by a news aggregator (Google News, Apple News)

### Priority Actions (ranked by likelihood of success)

**Tier 1 — Highest ROI, do these first:**

1. **Hacker News "Show HN" post** — If it hits the front page, tech journalists often write follow-up articles. This is the single fastest path to independent coverage. Post as: *"Show HN: I score every bill in Congress on a 1-10 absurdity scale"*
2. **Product Hunt launch** — Gets indexed by tech press; successful launches often get written up by indie tech bloggers
3. **Civic Tech Field Guide** — Already submitted. Follow up. If accepted, this counts as a notable curated directory listing

**Tier 2 — Direct pitches:**

4. **Pitch to civic tech press** — GovFresh, StateScoop, NextGov, Government Technology. Angle: *"Open-source tool brings satirical transparency to congressional legislation"*
5. **Pitch to political press** — The Hill, Roll Call, Washington Monthly. Angle: *"New site scores every bill in Congress — the pizza-as-vegetable provision earned a perfect 10"*
6. **Pitch to tech press** — Ars Technica, The Verge. Angle: *"Astro-powered civic tech project uses satire to make Congress accessible"*

**Tier 3 — Longer-term:**

7. **Guest posts on established publications** (see OUTREACH-GUEST-POSTS.md)
8. **Academic outreach** — Political science professors studying legislative process or civic engagement
9. **Conference submissions** — TICTeC, Code for America Summit, APSA
10. **Data journalism partnerships** — Pitch absurdity score trend data to data journalists

### What Counts as "Independent" for Wikipedia

- **YES:** A journalist writes an article about Absurdity Index in The Hill
- **YES:** A civic tech blog reviews the site independently
- **YES:** An academic paper cites the scoring methodology
- **YES:** A podcast interviews you about the project (if the podcast is notable)
- **NO:** Your own blog post, social media, or forum thread
- **NO:** A press release you wrote, even if a wire picks it up verbatim
- **NO:** A directory listing you submitted yourself (unless the directory is editorially curated)
- **NO:** A guest post you wrote for another site (that's still a primary source)
